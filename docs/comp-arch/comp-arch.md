### What is a Computer?

There are two Types of computers:

#### Fixed computers
- Programs are loaded onto the computer at manufacturing. (e.g. Calculator)

**vs**

#### Stored Computers
- Like computers nowadays.

#### The Von Neumann Model
A Computer is:

- A single, shared memory for programs and data, a single bus for memory access, an arithmetic unit, and a program control unit.
- The problem with this model was that there was only one line from instructions to memory.
- The instructions and operations could only be operated on one at a time.

#### High Level to Low Level

- Human legible code, such as Java and Python are high level languages, which means that it needs to be converted into Assembly Language and then machine language.

#### Harvard Architecture

- Separation of the different memory types moving the instruction memory and data memory to be separate.
- The problem with this architecture is the size and power consumption of this model because of having two physical memories.

#### The Operating Systems
- Programs run on the hardware, calling into OS for some services.
- On modern systems, OS and hardware collaborate for some features.

#### Moore's Law
- Gordon E. Moore was an Intel Engineer who noticed something.
- Observed that the number  of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months.
- Exponential growth is seen almost everywhere.

### Why Algorithms

- Cus they interesting.
- Algorithms and the ideas behind them are useful for real-life scenarios.
- They are important (for other courses, research, job interviews, ...)

#### Problem Solving

- Solve many problems.
- *Pattern recognition*.

### First Example: Stable Matching

> The 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Lloyd Shapley and Alvin Roth, for "*the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.*"

#### Matching

- There are `n` students applying for jobs/internships. There are `n` positions. Find a bijection (perfect matching) between students and positions.
- Notable examples: the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) matches U.S. med schools to students.


#### Quiz

> How many perfect matchings are there between `n` students and `n` jobs?

Ans: `n!` - `100 * 99 * 98 * ...`


#### Preference

- Not every matching is good.
- #todo wtf bruh its os all over again.

#### Notation

- Following the textbook notation, there is:
	- A set $M = {M_1, M_2, ..., M_n}$ of `n` men, and
	- A set $W = {W_1, W_2, ..., W_n}$ of `n` women.
- A perfect matching can be viewed as a bijection...

#### Stability

#todo get the definitions

- A preference even if they are not matched together. This is an *unstable match.*
	- They must both be unhappy to be an unstable match.
- A perfect matching is *stable* if it has no unstable pairs.

##### Do Stable Matchings Always Exist?

- A priori, it seems unclear whether stable matchings always exist in every instance.
- Every instance admits at least *one stable matching.*


#### Gale-Shapley Algorithm

> The Gale-Shapley Algorithm will help find a stable matching and prove that every instance will admit at least one stable matching.


#todo get the pseudocode for it.

##### Observation

**Lemma:** Gale-Shapley Algorithm outputs a perfect matching.

**Proof:** First, no person can be simultaneously matched with multiple partners at any time. Therefore, we only need to show that there are `n` engaged pairs at the en. Prove by contradiction and suppose that there are at most `n-1` engaged pairs... #todo fetch the rest.

---

**Fact:** Once $w \in W$ is engaged, her matches can only get better and better.

##### Theorem

> Gale_Shapley outputs a *stable* matching.

- **Proof**:

We need to prove that output matching is stable. Prove by contraction, and suppose that:

#todo finish filling

#### Men-Optimality of Gale-Shapley

- **Question:** When there are multiple stable matchings, which one will gale-Shapley pick?
- **Definition:** We call `w` a *valid partner* of `m` (and `m` a *valid partner* of `w`) if (`m,m`)... #todo finish

#### Women-Pessimality of Gale-Shapley

- **Theorem:** In Gale-Shapley, every $w \in W$ is matched with her worst valid partner (according to `w`).
- **Proof:** #todo get the proof

## Median of Medians

> The Median of Medians (MoM) algorithm takes an approximation of the *i*-th smallest item by dividing the array into 5 smaller groups, finding the median of each group, and putting those 5 in another group, finding the median for that again. Then, it uses that *approximated* median, and puts it as a pivot, sorting items to be either less than or greater than that number.

# Midterm Review

## Basics

> **Note:** Link to actual notes section [Here](cognitive-architecture#introduction).

#### Judgments
- Judgments are about what is the case.
- "Will it rain today?"

#### Decisions
- Decisions are about what action is performed.
- "Should I bring an umbrella?"

### Prominent Distinction in JDM Research

#### Descriptive Claims
- Claims about what *is* the case.
- "People think that hard work leads to success."

#### Normative Claims
- Claims about what *ought* to be the case.
- "People should believe that hard work is not the only thing that leads to success."


## Dual Process Theory

> **Note:** Actual notes linked [Here](cognitive-architecture#dual-processing-theory).

### Wason and Evans
- Introduced the "dual-process" theories of cognition.

In it, there are 2 qualitatively distinct kinds of processes:

### Type 1 Processes
- The popular story goes that Freud had discovered the unconscious while treating patients.
- However, research on the unconscious predates Freud.

#### History

**First half of 20th century:**

- Behaviorist movement in psych.
- Conscious and unconscious states were rejected.

**Second half of 20th century:**

- Cognitive revoltion.
- Mental representations regained respectability.
- Freud's psycho-analysis regarded as pseudo-science.

#### New Unconscious
- "The cognitive unconscious", or "adaptive unconscious".
- These states are not inherently accessible.
- It is very efficient and sophisticated but can go wrong under certain conditions. (*predictably wrong*)

### Type 2 Processing
- Allows us to perform reasoning and correct mistaken intuition.
- Imagine future possibilities.
- Aide complex verbal communication and learn new skills.

### Issues with DPT

#### Clustering Problem
- Do the attributes *always* go on the same side?
- Are some more fundamental than others?
- **EX:** Heuristics are judged to be rapid, intuitive judgments, but it seems to be rule based.

##### Gave Birth to the Evans and Stranovich Model
- Type 2 Processes demand working memory.
- Working memory is limited capacity and slow.
- Working memory is correlated with conscious.

## Memory (M-WM Model)

> M-WM stands for **multicomponent working-memory model**

> **Notes:** More in-depth info from CDM is linked [here](cognitive-architecture#working-memory) and info from Intro is linked [here](../cog-sci/8-memory)

### Long Term Memory

#### Procedural/Implicit
- This is the memory of how to do something. (e.g. ride a bike)

#### Declarative/Explicit
- Memory of facts, strings of sounds and words.

> Declarative is further split into [**Episodic**](../cog-sci/cog-sci-finals#episodic) and [**Semantic**](../cog-sci/cog-sci-finals#semantics) memories.

### Initial Baddeley and Hitch Model
- The **central executive** (Attention controller)
- The **phonological loop** (Verbal and Auditory info)
- The **visuospatial sketchpad** (Visual and spatial information)

#### Baddeley (2000) Later Added
- The **episodic buffer** (memory store and integration of information from *phonological loop* and *visuospatial sketchpad*)

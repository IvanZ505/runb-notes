## Basic Concepts

## Biases

> "When I describe *priming studies* to audiences, the reaction is often disbelief... disbelief is not an option. The results are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. **You have no choice but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true.** More important, you must accept that they are true about you. If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger." - *Daniel Kahneman*

### Bias Blindspot

- "I placed too much faith in underpowered studies... *law of small numbers*" with regards to underpowered studies that use unreasonably small samples.
- Their *own* work on heuristics and biases replicates well.

### Law of Small Numbers

Imagine an urn filled with marbles:

- Half red, half white.
- Draw blindfolded from the urn with replacement, repeatedly.
- Jack draws 4 marbles on each trial, Jill draws 7.
- They record each time they observe all white or all red.

*Who observes more?* Jack.


#### Survey of Schools
- In a survey of 1,662 schools in Pennsylvania, 6 of the top 50 were small.
- Small schools allow for more personal and tailored teacher-student interactions?
- Gates Foundation invested in creation of small schools, e.g. by splitting larger schools.
- However, bad schools *also* tended to be smaller than average.
- Small schools might not be **better** on average, but *may simply be more variable*.

### Samples

- The population
	- Everyone you are interested in

#### Why do people ignore this issue?
- *Law of small numbers* - people see sample as more representative as it really is.
- *Rationalization* of patterns in the data. (Our minds make up things to rationalize the data)

#### Sample Size
- An a priori power analysis calculates minimum number of observations required to achieve:
	- Desired significance level (often 5%) - probability of incorrectly rejecting the null, i.e. there is no effect, but you reject this.
	- Desired power (often 80%) - probability of correctly rejecting the null, i.e. detecting effect if one exists.
- Given an effect size of interest (true effect size is always unknown).

### Manufacturing Uncertainty

- Tobacco industry hiring researchers to divert attention from tabacco.

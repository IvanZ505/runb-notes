# Heuristics and Biases

## Objectives
- The battle of the JDM Superpowers: Cognitive illusions vs fast and frugal
- Dealing with uncertainty

## Heuristics
- Heuristics are a "quick and easy" rule to help us make judgments under conditions of uncertainty, with time limitations, and with our cognitive limitations.

### Kahneman
- Dual process theorist
- Classify heuristics as Type 1 processes
- We may override heuristics with Type 2 processes.

### Gigerenzer
- Critic of dual process theories
- Proposes "unified model" or "unimodel"
- Processes differ in extent to which they are conscious.

### Cognitive Illusions / Heuristics and biases

- Tversky and Kahneman
- Focus on when heuristics lead to systematic errors.
- **When is it a bad thing?**

### Fast and frugal / adaptive toolbox

 - Gigerenzer and colleagues  
 - Focus on when heuristics lead to best balance between maximizing accuracy and minimizing costs like cognitive processing and time.
 - **When is these heuristics a good thing?**

## Rationality Wars

**Great Rationality Debate** aka Rationality Wars:

- How rational/irrational are humans?
	- To what extent do we use heuristics?
	- What are the heuristics?
	- To what extent do heuristics help or hinder?
	- Which normative theories should we use?
	- Which tasks should our evolved minds be good at?

## Unimodels

### Misalignments in DPT
- Unconscious & slow: Sleeping on a problem
- Unconscious & intentional: Skilled activity e.g. speaking
- Uncontrollable & intentional: Bat and ball responses
- Unintentional & controllable: Stereotyping, mimicry of others
- Conscious & worse: Art poster study, etc..

Instead of Dual processes...

### Intuitive Judgments
- Quick, effortless, little or no conscious awareness of their origins or manner of formation.

### Deliberative Judgments
- Slow, effortful, conscious awareness of the process that led to them.

### Dual process theories
- Intuitive and deliberative judgments produced by two different kinds of processes with different kinds of rules.
- E.g. Representativeness heuristic and availability heuristic underlie intuitive judgments
- E.g. Statistical or logical rules underlie deliberative judgments.
### Unimodel
- Both intuitive judgments and deliberative judgments are rule based and the same rules can underlie both.
- Deliberative judgments not generally more accurate than intuitive judgments.

### How do we catch a ball?

- Some mathematical calculations (Dawkins 2006)
- **Gaze Heuristic**. [See more here](../cog-sci/10-the-rational-mind#bounded-rationality)

## The Availability Heuristic
- Estimating the probability of events based on how easily you can or could bring examples of those events to mind.
- An inference rule based on the **accessibility of exemplars**; the easier it is to bring examples of the event to conscious awareness, the  more likely the event is.
- Note that you can bring an example to mind through **memory** of past events or through **imagining** the events.

**Is the availability heuristic useful?**

Availability is typically a good cue since in general frequent events are easier to recall than infrequent events.

**When might the availability heuristic mislead us?**

Potential availability biases:
- Recent events.
- Dramatic events.
- Personal experiences.

### Ease/Speed
- Early studies of the availability heuristic failed to distinguish **ease**/**speed** with which examples come to mind and **number** of examples that come to mind.

**Which is the crucial factor?**
- Availabilitty-by-number hypothesis
- Availability-by-speed hypothesis

#### Study

- Participants asked to describe either 6 or 12 examples of very assertive or very unassertive behaviors in which they had engaged. 
- Pretests indicated that most subjects could easily generate 8 or 9 behaviors but found it very difficult to generate more than 10.  
- Participants then asked to rate their own assertiveness.  
- Participants attributed themselves higher assertiveness after recalling 6 rather than 12 examples of assertive behavior. 

This led to a famous (among JDM professors!) 2006 paper by Craig Fox called “The availability heuristic in the classroom: How soliciting more criticism can boost your course ratings”.

- Students completed a midcourse evaluation form in which they were asked to list either 2 ways in which the course could be improved (a relatively easy task) or 10 ways in which the course could be improved (a relatively difficult task).
- Respondents who had been asked for 10 critical comments subsequently rated the course more favorably than respondents who had been asked for 2 critical comments.

> Studies show that it is typically the *number* of examples that come to mind that matter.

### Law of Small Numbers

**Law of Large Numbers**

- Large samples will be representative of the population from which they are drawn.
- For example, proportions of heads after *n* flips of a fair coin will almost surely converge to 0.5 as *n* approaches infinity.

**Law of Small Numbers**

- Law of large numbers is (incorrectly) applied to small numbers, e.g. six flips of a coin.

---
## Representative Heuristics

- When A is judged more probable than B whenever A appears more representative than B.

**What is *representativeness*?**

- How similar an example is to members of its class.
- How similar a sequence is to what we think randomness is like.

### Tom Problem

- **Base Rate Condition**
	- Considering all the percentages of students enrolled in 9 different fields.
	- Then another group of participants were told some things about "Tom's" personalities.
	- Two conditions: **Similarity condition** and **Prediction condition**
		- Rank how similar Tom is to prototypical student of each area.
		- Predict the likelihood that Tom is now a graduate student in each of these fields.
	- **Question:** Are judgments of the likelihood that Tom is student in a field predicted by perceived base-rates or similarities?
	- **Results:** Similarity, not base rates, correlated positively with predictions.
	- **Conclusions:** People display "base rate neglect" and instead use the representativeness heuristic.

> Variations yielding same results.
> The *problem* is not that we are relying on the representative heuristic. However, the problem is that we **fail** to take into account *other* information that is relevant.

### Linda Problem

- Participants were told some facts about Linda. (31, single, outspoken, bright, majored in philosophy, deeply concerned with discrimination)
- Divided into 3 groups for naive, informed and sophisticated group
- Ranking 8 statements found that more people ranked **conjunctive** statements as higher than just independent statements by themselves.
	- This is even though the chance for a conjunctive statement being true is **ALWAYS** less than the chance for 1 statement being true.

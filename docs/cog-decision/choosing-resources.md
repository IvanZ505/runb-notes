# Choosing Resources

## Bounded Rationality

### Classical Theories of Rational Choice
- Classical theories of rational choice given by von Neumann & Morgenstern (1944) made idealizations:
	- People have **complete knowledge** of all the options and their consequences.
	- People can do **complex calculations** to arrive at the optimal choice.

### Principles of Expected Utility Theory
- **Quantification:** We can express any given person's preferences numerically and call it utility.
- **Completeness:** The decision maker can state a preference for one of two outcomes, or that they are equally preferred.
- **Transitivity:** The decision maker's preferences are transitive (consistently ranked-order): if A is preferred to B, and B is preferred to C, then A is preferred to C.
- **Maximization:** The decision maker's goal in making a choice is to maximize utility.

In this **transitivity model:** Theoretically, if you prefer Beyonce over Rihanna, and Lady Gaga over Beyonce, you should theoretically prefer Lady Gaga over Rihanna.

#### Calculating Expected Utilities

Expected Utility (EU) of a scenario is: P(A) * Utility(A) + P(¬A) * Utility(¬A)

----

- Herbert Simon pointed out that for choices to be adaptive, they do not need to lead to the best possible situations. (*Maximizing*)
- They need only to lead to situations that are "good enough" (*Satisficing*)
- Perform more calculations than is needed is actually more costly (*timewise, energywise...*)
- A theory of rationality should take into account the **limited access to information** and the limited computational capacities that people actually possess in the kinds of environments in which we make choices.
- Such a theory would be a theory of "**bounded rationality**" (*Bounded by human limitations*)

---

- The notion of bounded rationality fits well with work on heuristics and helps to explain behavior that at *first glance* doesn’t seem to be rational.
- For example, sometimes we assume that providing more options or more information is better for decision-making. However, that is not always the case.
- When making decisions more complicated we must consider cognitive limitations. Consider, for example, the **choice overload effect**.

## Choice Overload
- The **choice overload affect** says that the complexity of the decision problem faced by an individual exceeds the individual's cognitive resources and is **detrimental** to choice.
- For instance, decision complexity caused by a large number of consumer options can lead to fewer sales.

### Iyengar & Lepper (2000)
- Offered free samples of 6 or 24 jams at a supermarket booth.
	- People were more likely to stop at booth with 6 samples (60% vs 40% of passersby)
	- Of those who tried jams, people more likely to buy from 6 sample booth (30% vs 3%)

### Moderating Factors
- More likely when people aren't very familiar with the things they are choosing between (and therefore don't already have a strong preference).
- More likely when under time pressure.
- More likely when items are difficult to compare.

### Satisficing vs Maximizing
- **Fewer options**: free rein to satisfice - and make a decision that will be good enough without requiring strenuous mental gymnastics.
- **Many options**: pressure to maximize and attempt the best-quality decision.

#### Schwartz et al (2002)
- Positively correlated with feeling regretful and with being perfectionistic.
- Negatively correlated with feeling happy, feeling satisfied with life, being optimistic, and having high self-esteem.
- They speculated that possessing the drive to maximize one's decisions makes it difficult to feel fully content with whatever the outcome may be.
- One is *more pleased* with the choice if they were not trying to maximize them at the time the choice was made.

## Nudge Theory

Decisions regarding whether and how to spend our resources of time, money, effort and opportunity can be swayed by others.

For example, tools traditionally used by governments include:

- Mandates and bans (e.g. *civil laws prevent theft and assualt*)
- Incentives and decentives (e.g. *subsidies for renewable fuels, taxes on tabacco products*)
- Advertising campaigns.

### Libertarian Paternalism
- In the past decade, a hugely influential approach to government has emerged: “libertarian paternalism”.  
- This new approach is the “nudge theory” of Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein.  
- It seeks to use findings in behavioral science – concerning willpower and the effects of cognitive, emotional and social factors on decision making – to help people by orchestrating their choices in such a way that they are more likely to do  
what achieves their goals.  
- Choice architecture is the environment in which people make decisions.  
- Anyone who constructs that environment is a choice architect.

**Paternalism** - interference in the life of another person, without their consent, motivated by the belief that the interference will leave the person better-of.

#### What are Nudges?
- To qualify as a nudge, an initiative must not impose significant material incentives or disincentives.
	- A **subsidy** is not a nudge.
	- A **tax** is not a nudge.
	- A **fine** is not a nudge.
	- A **jail sentence** is not a nudge.

What, then, *is* a nudge? Sunstein points to the following:

- Default rules (e.g. automatic enrollment in programs)
- Simplifications (e.g. to promote take-up of programs)
- Using social norms (e.g. “most people pay their taxes on time”)
- Convenience (e.g. make certain options clearly visible)
- Disclosures (e.g. the costs associated with energy use)
- Warnings (e.g. health risks for cigarettes)
- Reminders (e.g. emails or text messages for overdue bills)  
- Information disclosures (e.g. releasing consumer information)  
- Elicit implementation intentions (e.g. “do you plan to vaccinate your child?”)
- Precommitment strategies (e.g. ask people to commit to a specific course of action at a precise future moment in time)

#### Wansink, Painter, and Ittersum (2001)
- Conducted a six-week long field study of six items on a menu at a faculty cafeteria. They replaced regular names with descriptive names.
- Whenever they made this change, there was an **increase in sales by 27%**.

#### Goncalves et al (2021)
- Social norm nudge for three months in a Portuguese supermarket and measured fruit and vegetable purchase quantities of 1636 customers using loyalty card data.
- They were they split into 3 groups based on how many fruits and vegetables they bought. (Soft buyers, Medium buyers, hard buyers)
- They then put a bunch of signs and images of fruit that said: "*The healthiest families of this store purchase at least eleven fruits and vegetables per visit. And you?*"
- They noticed that the soft buyers increased their fruits and vegetables purchasing by almost 60%.

#### Milkman et al (2022)
- Walmart pharmacy flu shot messages. (22 different messages)
- 29.4% in control condition received a flu shot. 

**Example Interventions:**

- Humor to increase memorability ("Did you hear about that joke about the flu? Nevermind, don't want to spread it around.")
- Social norms
- Prompting ppatients to text back if they planned to get a vaccine.
- 1 text vs 2 texts.

##### Results
Each of the 22 interventions significantly increased vaccination rates relative to the control conditions.

- The top-performing intervention produced a 2.9% increase in flu vaccinations (+9.9% from the control)
- This intervention included two text messages:
	- "It's flu season & you can get a flu shot at Walmart."
	- 72 hrs later: "A flu shot is waiting for you at Walmart."

###### Why?
- Milkman suggested that *ownership language* is important.
- Ownership Factor: Indicated the vaccine had "just been made available to you" and encouraged participants to "claim your dose."
- Video Factor: Provided link to 2-minute video.

> Evidence found that ownership language boosted appointment. (Dai et. al (2021))

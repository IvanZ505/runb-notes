# Society and Groups

## Groupthink
- Group decision-making can be beneficial, providing all relevant evidence is considered.
- However, when there is a tendency to seek evidence that serves only to confirm an initial hypothesis or to support a pre-determined course of action, group decision making can go badly wrong.
- **Coined by Irving Janis** (1972)

### Groupthink Symptoms
- Overestimation of the group:
	- The *illusion of invulnerability* creating excessive optimism and encouraging extreme risk-taking.
	- An unquestioned *belief in the inherent morality of the group*, inclining members to ignore the ethical or moral consequences.
- Closed-mindedness:
	- **Collective rationalization:** to discount warning that might lead members to reconsider their assumptions.
	- **Stereotyped view of rivals:** as too evil to warrant genuine attempts to negotiate.
- Uniformity:
	- **Self-censorship** of doubts or counterarguments that a member might have.
	- **Illusion of unanimity** within the group.
	- **Direct pressure** on dissenters.
	- The emergence of self-appointed **mindguards** who protect the group from a diverse information that might shatter shared complacency about the effectiveness and morality of the group's decisions.

#### Wisdom of the Crowd

##### Group Voting

- **Condorcet Jury Theorem** - For a choice with exactly two options, only one of which is correct.
- Voters choose independently by majority vote.
- When for each group member the probability that they identify the correct option is higher than 0.5, the probability that the majority votes for the correct option increases and approaches 1 as the number of voters goes to infinity.
- When for each group member, the probability that they identify the correct choice is less than 0.5, the probability that the majority vote for correct option decreases and the optimal jury is a single voter.
- This is *group voting*, what about group *averaging*?

##### Study
- Estimate weight of ox. (800 competitors)
- Winner would get a prize.
- The median estimate was extremely close to the actual weight, but the *mean* estimate was even closer (1 pound away)
- "This result is, I think, more creditable to the trust-worthiness of a democratic judgment that might have been expected."

## Group Reasoning
- Wason's 4-card selection task started it off.

- In individual conditions, when given the correct solution and asked to justify it, 49% either argued that it was incorrect or indicated that they did not know why you would turn those cards.

### Surowiecki's 3 Conditions for Wise Crowds
1. **Aggregation**: There is an effective way to turn private judgments into a colelctive decision (e.g. via voting systems)
2. **Cognitive** Diversity: Each person thinks about the issue in a different way or has access to different information (e.g. via sociological diversity).
3. **Independence**: People's opinions are not determined by the opinions of those around them.

# [Society and Groups](cog-decision)

## Groupthink
- Group decision-making can be beneficial, providing all relevant evidence is considered.
- However, when there is a tendency to seek evidence that serves only to confirm an initial hypothesis or to support a pre-determined course of action, group decision making can go badly wrong.
- **Coined by Irving Janis** (1972)

### Groupthink Symptoms
- Overestimation of the group:
	- The *illusion of invulnerability* creating excessive optimism and encouraging extreme risk-taking.
	- An unquestioned *belief in the inherent morality of the group*, inclining members to ignore the ethical or moral consequences.
- Closed-mindedness:
	- **Collective rationalization:** to discount warning that might lead members to reconsider their assumptions.
	- **Stereotyped view of rivals:** as too evil to warrant genuine attempts to negotiate.
- Uniformity:
	- **Self-censorship** of doubts or counterarguments that a member might have.
	- **Illusion of unanimity** within the group.
	- **Direct pressure** on dissenters.
	- The emergence of self-appointed **mindguards** who protect the group from a diverse information that might shatter shared complacency about the effectiveness and morality of the group's decisions.

#### Wisdom of the Crowd

##### Group Voting

- **Condorcet Jury Theorem** - For a choice with exactly two options, only one of which is correct.
- Voters choose independently by majority vote.
- When for each group member the probability that they identify the correct option is higher than 0.5, the probability that the majority votes for the correct option increases and approaches 1 as the number of voters goes to infinity.
- When for each group member, the probability that they identify the correct choice is less than 0.5, the probability that the majority vote for correct option decreases and the optimal jury is a single voter.
- This is *group voting*, what about group *averaging*?

##### Study
- Estimate weight of ox. (800 competitors)
- Winner would get a prize.
- The median estimate was extremely close to the actual weight, but the *mean* estimate was even closer (1 pound away)
- "This result is, I think, more creditable to the trust-worthiness of a democratic judgment that might have been expected."

## Group Reasoning
- Wason's 4-card selection task started it off.

- In individual conditions, when given the correct solution and asked to justify it, 49% either argued that it was incorrect or indicated that they did not know why you would turn those cards.

### Surowiecki's 3 Conditions for Wise Crowds
1. **Aggregation**: There is an effective way to turn private judgments into a collective decision (e.g. via voting systems)
2. **Cognitive** Diversity: Each person thinks about the issue in a different way or has access to different information (e.g. via sociological diversity).
3. **Independence**: People's opinions are not determined by the opinions of those around them.

## Social Decision Making
- In decision making, people often need to consider not only their own preferences, but also their expectations about others' preferences, and how others will behave.
- Game theory studies decisions in strategic interactions, where the outcome depends on what other people do.

### Basic Concepts

**Analytical Game Theory**:

- How people *should* behave (normative theory)
- To "solve" a game is to find the strategies rational players would choose.
- Like expected utility theory, has also been used to model and predict behavior.

**Behavioral Game Theory**:

- How people *actually* behave in strategic interactions.

### Prisoner's Dilemma
- Suppose you and another prisoner are held in separate cells, for two joint offences.
- You are told there is not enough evidence to convict you both of the serious offense, unless one of you confesses.
- If you both confess, you each get 10 years.
- If one of you confesses, that person will get 1 year and the other will get 20 years.
- If neither of you confess, you will get 2 years each for the less serious crime.

> What is the rational thing to do? *Confess or not confess?*
### The Nash Equilibrium
- A set of strategies such that any given player cannot achieve a better outcome by a unilateral *change of decision*.
	- (ie.) each player can't improve on their strategy, given that the other players stick with their strategies.
- In the *prisoner's dilemma*, there is only one Nash Equilibrium, "both confessing".

> "Every player has *no regrets*, given what they know."

***Special Case:*** *Dominant strategy equilibrium* - each player cannot improve on strategy, no matter which strategies the other players play.

- When presented with *prisoner's dilemma*, people tend to defect less than game theory predicts.
	- About *one-third* of people cooperate.

#### The Dilemma is
- **Noncooperative** - Can't form binding agreements.
- **Static / simultaneous-strategy** - Don't know what the other person has done.
- **Symmetric** - Everyone faces same strategies and outcomes - identities of players can be switched.
- **Nonzero-sum** - You needn't win exactly what the other person loses.
- **Finite** - ends after a finite series of moves.
- **Non-iterated** - played only ones.

### Zero-sum Game
- In a *zero-sum game*, the possible gains and losses among a set of players equals zero.
- e.g. If one person gains two cookies and two other people each lose a cookie:
	- +2 -1 -1 = 0
- Maximizing one's own utility can *sometimes* directly clash with maximizing the utility of the group, especially when resources are limited or finite, e.g. in the tragedy of the commons. (Hardin 1968)

> Many nonzero-sum games **cannot** be solved.

### One-shot Ultimatum Game
- Two individuals divide a sum of money between them.
- Say the stake is \$100.
- The proposer makes an offer between \$0 and \$100.
- If the receiver accepts, they get the amount offered and the proposer gets the remainder.
- If the receiver rejects, both players get zero.

*Using \$100*: 

- Most offered half (\$50)
- Average offer about 48%
- Offers of less than \$40 were frequently rejected.

## Moral Judgment

- The media tends to focus on unethical behavior that is extreme: *murder*, *assault*, hate crime, and so forth.

### Immorality
- DePaulo asked participants to record all of their social interactions and all of the lies that they told during those interactions every day for a week.
	- College students reported lying in approximately one out of every 3 of their social interactions, thought these were not typically "serious lies"
	- About twice as many lies were told to benefit the liars as to benefit other people.
- **Examples:** "I led a girl to believe that I was a model with a New York Agency"

#### Dan Ariely
- People tend to take advantage of ambiguity.
- Placed six Coca-Cola cans and six one-dollar bills in MIT dorm.
- All cans were taken with 72 hours, but no dollar bills were taken, though their value is the same!
- Stealing cans can be *easier to rationalize*.

# Society and Groups

## Groupthink
- Group decision-making can be beneficial, providing all relevant evidence is considered.
- However, when there is a tendency to seek evidence that serves only to confirm an initial hypothesis or to support a pre-determined course of action, group decision making can go badly wrong.
- **Coined by Irving Janis** (1972)

### Groupthink Symptoms
- Overestimation of the group:
	- The *illusion of invulnerability* creating excessive optimism and encouraging extreme risk-taking.
	- An unquestioned *belief in the inherent morality of the group*, inclining members to ignore the ethical or moral consequences.
- Closed-mindedness:
	- **Collective rationalization:** to discount warning that might lead members to reconsider their assumptions.
	- **Stereotyped view of rivals:** as too evil to warrant genuine attempts to negotiate.
- Uniformity:
	- **Self-censorship** of doubts or counterarguments that a member might have.
	- **Illusion of unanimity** within the group.
	- **Direct pressure** on dissenters.
	- The emergence of self-appointed **mindguards** who protect the group from a diverse information that might shatter shared complacency about the effectiveness and morality of the group's decisions.

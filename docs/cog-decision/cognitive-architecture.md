# Cognitive Architecture

## Introduction

**Descriptive Claims:**
- Claims about what *is* the case.
- E.g. What people actually decide. What are the psychological processes leading to the decisions are. (Most students don't cheat on exams.) Paul *thinks*

**Normative Claims:**
- Claims that *ought* to be the case.
- E.g. You shouldn't cheat on exams. Paul *should*

**Replication Studies**
- Before people who did replications of classic studies and quoted multiple times were not rewarded because they wouldn't get any advancements in their career from it.
- However, people then began realizing that these classical theories and experiments actually didn't replicate.

- Review some of the different kinds of research questions that are examined in the field of judgement and decision making, and considering how the field may be pertinent to your own life in a variety of ways.
- Compare two of the major empirical approaches to studying and understanding everyday judgement and decision-making - the cognitive illusions approach and the fast-and-frugal approach.
- Consider arguments for and against whether dual-process models of reasoning can serve as an organizing framework for the field.
- Understood and compared three major types of decision-making models (i.e., descriptive, normative, and prescriptive), and how each type of model has distinct but important goals, and how they relate to one another.

## Dual Processing Model

### Key Terms

- Personal Decisions - Making choices that *are* essentially under our own control.
- Cognitive illusions - systematic ways in which people make errors in subjective judgement.
	- Visual perception, 3D-like images.
	- The point of cognitive illusions literature is to pinpoint the times when using these simple **affects** will lead to mistaken judgements.
- Affect - Something that can influence your decision making.
	- Feeling positively about a job, emotions.
	- People use affect much of the time to make judgements. (i.e. comedians making jokes vs decisions based on that comedian.)
- Fast-and-frugal approach (to judgement and decision making) - emphasized how the use of mental shortcuts is adaptive.
	- This leads to the best *balance* between minimizing the costs of cognitive processing and maximizing the accuracy of decisions.
	- Gigerenzer Approach! (Identifies how these shortcuts get people through complex decisions and also identifies them.)
- Computational capacity - There is a limited amount of information that we can process at a time. 
	- Mental shortcuts using the fast and frugal method help us navigate this shortcoming.
- **Dual-process models** - The most popular of organizing frameworks for organizing the findings of different mental shortcuts and the conditions in which they do and do not appear. [See More Below ↓](#dual-process-models)
- System 1; System 2 [See More Below ↓](#dual-process-models)
- Associative/ Rule-based
- Type 1; Type 2 processing
- Descriptive Models - Attempt to describe how people **actually** judge and decide, without saying whether it is good or bad. (Dual processing model falls into this category)
- Normative Models - Reflect the *optimal* or ideal decision-making. (Logical, consistent with one's past decisions and preferences, and takes all known relevant data into consideration)
	- Should get a person closest to achieving his or her own goals over the long run.
- Prescriptive Models - Recommend a particular way in which people ought to judge and decide. (May or may not be a normalized way, but thought to be an improvement)
	- *Think of doctors prescribing a general antibiotic for what seems like a normal viral infection.*
- Uncertainty - When a numerical, probabilistic prediction cannot be made because the events are relatively unique and past events are not relevant enough to provide appropriate data for calculating probabilities.
- Risk - The potential costs and benefits of that action. Defers from uncertainty in that risk refers to judging the likelihood of events for which past relevant numerical data are available.

### Why Study Cognition and Decision Making

- Figuring out how and why people make the decisions that they do is important not only from a public wellness perspective, but also to us personally as we live our lives.
	- Can help us make informed decisions for our lives and our careers.

### Dual Process Models

**Dual process models** are a broad group of theories suggesting that judgements and decisions are generally carried out via two distinct kinds of mental processes.

These two processes are commonly referred two as **systems**, or, *more recently*, **types** of processing.

#### System 1
- Traditionally meant to refer to fast, intuitive, parallel (i.e. simultaneous), automatic, emotion driven, and not always conscious driven.
- I.E. an unconscious stereotype

#### System 2
- Generally used to refer to cognitively taxing, deliberate, **serial**, controlled reason-driven, and/or consciously accessible processes.
- I.E. attempt to override that stereotype by consciously reasoning it is unfair to stereotype anyone.
- **System 2 processing can override system 1 processing**

### Sloman (1996)
- Suggested that the two systems in the Dual System Model followed two different properties.
- Before him, researchers treated judgements as only following one or the other. He argued that they have both systems for reasoning and that these systems could operate *simultaneously* in the same person.
- While the *associativity* model and the *rule-based* model theoretically **could** generate the same judgement, it does **not** necessary **have to**.

#### Associativity
- One of the systems (System 1) is based on similarities and statistical information.
- i.e. Classifying a robin as a robin because it is visually similar to our memories of a robin.

#### Rule Based
- The other system uses a set of logical rules, or rules of the social or natural world, or computer algorithms that minds use to compute decisions or judgement.
- i.e. Classifying a bird as a robin using the rules that define a robin.

### Stanovich and West (2000)

- Did a comprehensive review of the dual-process models that had been proposed over the years and noted the similarities.
- Coined the terms System 1 and System 2 to suggest that global distinctions could be made between these two clusters of processes.

---
#### Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)
- Designed to detect individual differences in the use of System 1 vs System 2 processing.
- Introduced as a measure of the disposition to reflect on a question and resist reporting the first response that comes to mind.
- So many people had completed that test that they had to develop a second, alternative questionnaire to measure the same thing.

### Issues Arising with Dual Processing
- Sometimes critiqued for being vague and poorly defined.
- Became apparent that the proposed attributes of each system do not always co-occur.
	- Being fast, automatic and unconscious do not always coincide with also processing associatively.
	- It appears to be possible for deliberate and intuitive processing to be based on rules...

### Evans (2008)
- Suggested that the Dual Processing framework was still viable due to common elements to each process that could still be found in all the different dual-process theories.

Suggested the terms:

#### Type 1 Processing
- Automatic, non-conscious, and fast
- Instead of System 1

#### Type 2 Processing
- Deliberate, slow, conscious
- **Only type 2 is** tied to our working memory
- Instead of System 2

These terms help to acknowledge that they reflect different  kinds of processing rather than entire systems of processing.

### Evans and Stranovich (2013)
- Refined and narrowed the definition of dual-process models.
- Described type 1 as intuitive and type 2 as reflective.
- Identified a few attributes that can always be used to distinguish Type 1 processing from Type 2. 
	- Working memory distinction!
	- Type 1 processing includes automatic processing and processing done by habit.
	- Type 2 processing includes reflections and can be carried out in detachment from reality. (Hypothetical thinking, Thinking about the future)

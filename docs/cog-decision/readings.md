## Week 2: A Theory of Unconscious Thought

- Unconscious thought is much better at differentiating a more desirable choice.
- **Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT)** - Consists of six principles pertaining to unconscious and conscious thought.
	- Two types of thought: Conscious and unconscious.
	- The two modes have different characteristics and make them appropriate to use under different circumstances.
- **The Capacity Principle** - Conscious thought has a limited capacity of around 7. (This is the [7±2 Rule for Short term memory](,,/cog-sci/8-memory))
- **Bottom-Up-Versus-Top-Down Principle** - Unconscious works bottom-up, consciousness works top-down. Info on [Bottom-up and Top-down](../cog-sci/7-the-minds-eye#Processing)
	- This is ironic as people associate things such as stereotypes with influence from top-down processing, and would think this happens automatically and unconsciously. But no, stereotyping actually occurs more in conscious thought than unconscious thought.
- Unconscious thought leads to better organization of information in memory.
	- Thoughts and characteristics are better organized into clusters when thought of unconsciously.
- **The Weighing Principle** - The unconscious naturally weights the relative importance of various attributes. Conscious thought disturbs this natural process leading to suboptimal weighting.
	- Roommates example: Person thinking subconsciously is more likely to recall positive things about a desirable roommate and negative things about an undesirable one and less likely to recall positive things about the undesirable roommate and negative things about the desirable one.
	- Conscious thought leads people to put disproportionate weight on attributes that are accessible, plausible and easy to verbalize.
- **The Rule Principle** - Conscious thought can follow strict rules and is precise, whereas unconscious thought gives rough estimates.
	- Ex: what is 13 ⨉ 14? You have to consciously think about it. No matter how hard you unconsciously think about the answer, or for how long, you won't get the answer. (*Unconscious thought has estimates on the basis of numbers, but does not engage in real arithmetic*)
	- *The unconscious can not deal well with negations once they are properly encoded.*
		- However, they need to be consciously aware they are encoding a negation, or they can not process the negation. This is the *Negation Rule*
- **Convergence-Versus-Divergence Principle** - Conscious thought, and memory search during conscious thought, is focused and convergence. Unconscious thought is more divergent.
- **Set Shifting** - Changing the approach to a problem, or a change in mental set. (*Thinking in a different direction*)
	- Set Shifting through letting the unconscious think and letting the conscious forget can lead to more creative and unorthodox answers.
- **Deliberation-Without-Attention Hypothesis** - Conscious thought is good when things are simple, and becomes worse as the complexity of the decision problem increases.
	- But also, those who thought **more** about a **less complexed** decision and those who thought **less** about a **more complexed** decision would be happier with their decision than those who did the opposite.
- 3 Routes in the UTT, No thought, unconscious (relatively effortless), and conscious (effortful)
- UTT differs from other models by adding the idea that people think unconsciously.
- WADD (Weighted Adding Strategy) - Chooser assesses importance of different attributes and assigns a choice alternative a value on each attribute. Then, multiplies the value for that alternative by the importance of the attribute dimension.
	- Ex: "Culture is important for a holiday destination." and "Tuscany is excellent for culture."
	- **Conscious thought is not able to engage in WADD**

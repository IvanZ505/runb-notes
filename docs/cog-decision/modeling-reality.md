# Modeling Reality

## Schemas and Frameworks

- Commonsense/intuitive background knowledge in three domains:
	- **Biology**
	- **Physics**
	- **Psychology**
- Develop early in life.
- Organize our understanding of new information.
	- **Elizabeth Spelke** argues that there are at least six innate systems of "core knowledge" that support intuitions

#### Schema Theories
- Schemas are **general knowledge** about what you have **learned** to expect.
- We rely on stored background knowledge, activated by even a single word, to make sense of new info.
- Content of schemas guides how we make sense of current situations.

> These schemas can influence learning and performance...


**Entity Theory**: Intelligence is a fixed trait.

**Increment Theory:** Intelligence is a flexible trait.

##### Study (Brickwell)
- 7th graders who held entity theory tended to explain setbacks by thinking they were not good at that thing and gave up.
- 7th graders who held incremental theory tended to explain setbacks by thinking they didn't work hard enough and tried different strategies.
- Although students with the entity and increment theories did not differ significantly in their math achievement scores as they entered junior high, but diverged over subsequent 2 years of junior high.

#### Scripts
- Scripts are sets of general knowledge for a **routine event**
- Scripts are picked up over time by observation, and our memories of them make it possible for us to quickly understand and know what to expect in many routine types of situations.

##### Script Violations
- Violations of scripts make stories more interesting since they fail to meet our expectations (Bower et al 1979):
	- Errors (order coffee, are served spaghetti)
	- Obstacles (no server, unable to order food)
	- Distractions (car towed, run out of restaurants)
- When presented with stories, script violations (especially obstacles and distractions) are remembered better than script-consistent components.

### Legal Decisions

> How do jurors process information?

#### Simple Model
- Each piece of information contributes a particular value regarding guiltiness vs innocence.
- These can be weighted in terms of how important they are and combine to form an assessment.
- A weighted average of this assessment and the juror's initial (prior to deliberation) judgement of guilt/innocence yields the final decision.

##### Limitations
- Court cases have a great deal of complexity that is not easily entered into such straightforward decisions.
- Pieces of evidence need to be interpreted *in light* of other pieces of information.

#### Story Model
- Jurors construct an initial story to make sense of the evidence.
- The story is constructed by using a schema about the initiating event, which influences the psychological state of the defendant at the time, which explains the defendant's actions and their consequences.

##### Example
1. The defendant was accosted in a bar while drunk.  
2. This led to anger that he was unable to suppress due to drunkenness.  
3. This led to the goal of teaching the aggressor a lesson.  
4. This led to attacking the aggressor with the fishing knife he carries.  
5. The aggressor died due to the stab wounds.

#### Pennington & Hastie (1986)
- Jurors watched the same trial.
- Jurors thought about the trial out loud.
- Jurors disagreed about verdict.
- Think-aloud data showed that they constructed different stories: 55% of the elements in the stories came from the testimonials and 45% came from inferences about the suspect's mental states and goals.

**Background Theories Matter!**

##### Follow-up Study
- Also by Pennington & Hastie in 1988
- 119 evidence items.
- **Scramble order**: "witness by witness" - policemen justify about the fight in the evening, the medical examiner testifies about the time of death and the nature of the wound, a friend testifies about the events in the morning preceding the fatal encounter, and so forth.
- **Temporal order**: beginning with testimony about events preceding the fatal encounter, followed by testimony concerning the fight that resulted in the victim's death, followed by testimony about the arrest and the autopsy.

###### Results
- Temporal order is a guide to causal relationships, which stories are built around. 
- 78% of participants gave “guilty” verdict when prosecution evidence was presented in temporal order and defense evidence was presented in scrambled order.
- 31% of participants gave “guilty” verdict when prosecution evidence was presented in scrambled order and defense evidence was presented in temporal order.

> “our results strongly support the conclusion that story construction is an essential part of evidence comprehension, which in turn determines the verdict choice. Thus, an interpretation of the Story Model of evidence evaluation in which stories are constructed as post-decision justifications is rejected.”
## Hypothesis Testing
- Originally called a "*bias towards verification*"
- Wason did not claim that participants desire to show that the rule was true.
- This would be odd, since the rule is abstract and arbitrarily chosen.
- Instead, he claimed that participants rely on a positive test strategy to examine whether the rule is true.

### Positive Test Strategy
- Examine instances in which the property or event is expected to occur (to see if it does occur)
- Examine instances in which it is known to have occurred (to see if the hypothesized conditions prevail)

> It is a positive test strategy if **they are only looking for** positive test strategies.

- A *positive test strategy* may be implemented without the researcher's awareness, and it can also appear in the reinterpretation of evidence to fit the hypothesis.
- This can be contrasted with a *negative test strategy*, in which you instead try to run tests or find cases that might rule out or disconfirm your working hypothesis. (e.g. trying to find a raven that is any color other than black.)
### Karl Popper

> Something more than just confirmatory evidence is needed to qualify as evidence for a hypothesis.

- According to Adler's theory: Human actions are motivated by feelings of inferiority.
- Now consider the following case: A man is standing on the bank and the instant a child falls into the river nearby. The man leaps into the river in an attempt to save the child.
	- Adler can use the theory to explain this by saying: the man needed to overcome his feeling of inferiority by demonstrating that he was brave.
	- Now, if he did not jump, Adler can also use this theory to offer the explanation: The man had a feeling of inferiority that led him to think he is not the kind of person who could do something heroic like saving a child.

- Popper noted that by making a testable prediction, the general theory of relativity was put at risk.
- Popper drew the moral that genuine scientific theories are falsifiable.
- Theories are not derived by induction. They are tentative conjectures that attempt to solve problems.

*Now suppose a Theory passes a test...*

- Does this establish it as true or probably true in the light of observational evidence?

**Popper denies that it does**: A scientific theory can be show to be false (*refuted or falsified*) but can not be shown to be true (*confirmed or verified*).

- According to Popper, a theory that has passed tests has been "corroborated" by past experience.
- *Science progresses by trial and error*, by conjectures and refutations, only the fittest theories survive.

#### Ad Hoc Modification
- Suppose that a theory fails a test... *Is it possible to modify the theory?*
- Karl Popper allows for modifications of a theory in lieu of completely rejecting it.
- However, the modification can **not** be ad hoc.
- An *ad hoc modification* is one where there is no testable consequences that were not already testable consequences of the unmodified theory.
- The new theory can not be "less falsifiable" than the original unmodified theory.
### Forensics

> ***Forensic Confirmation Bias:*** Prior expectations influence how evidence is collected and interpreted.

- Mayfield case where someone was falsely convicted of bombing Madrid trains.
- When the Spanish police identified a different match for the fingerprint, the FBI also agreed with them, and started to identify things that were not actually there.

### Medicine
- In trying to make a diagnosis, clinicians may first formulate a rough preliminary evaluation and then search in a confirmatory manner for the features that would support that diagnosis.
- Study with medical interns and physicians at 3 psychiatric hospitals.

#### What they did
- A case vignette was presented to the subjects:
	- Mr L (64 yrs old) is delievered to your clinic by the EMS. He seems to be heavily sedated and the physician's referral note states "suspicion of overdose on sleeping pills."
	- By the next day, Mr L is now fully alert and tells you that he is usually a fun and happy person, but recently has been on the brink of tears.
	- Mr L is neat in appearance and well kempt but seems quite dejected.
- They could ask for 12 more pieces of information that would help confirm either depression or alzheimers.

### Reason Based Choice
- When people have weak or conflicting intuitions, they tend to make the decision for which it is easiest to find reasons- the decisions that they can best justify.

#### Myside bias
- A tendency to find arguments that defend one's position or refuting a position one disagrees with.

## Belief

**Biased assimilation** of evidence:

- Remember strengths of confirming evidence but weaknesses of disconfirming evidence.
- Biased assimilation can lead to **polarization**.
- Through biased assimilation even a random set of outcomes or events can appear to lend support for an entrenched position, and both sides in a debate can have their positions bolstered by the same set of data.

**Attitude Polarization**:

- The net effect of exposition proponents and opponents of capital punishment to identical evidence was to increase further the gap between their views.

### Disconfirmation Bias
- When people are faced with evidence contrary to their beliefs, people try to undermine the evidence.
- That is, there is a bias to disconfirm arguments incompatible with one's position.
- Arguments incompatible with prior beliefs are scrutinized longer, subjected to more extensive refutational analyses, and consequently are judged to be weaker than arguments compatible with prior beliefs.

### Motivated Skepticism
- A form of *motivated reasoning/ motivated judgement*.

> "People are less skeptical consumers of desirable than undesirable information ... information consistent with a preferred judgment is examined less critically than information inconsistent with a preferred conclusion, and consequently, less information is required to reach a preference-consistent conclusion than a preference-inconsistent one."
#### Magical Contagion Effect
- Objects can acquire the "essence" of a source through physical contact with that source.
- Sometimes described as a contagion heuristic: 'once in contact, always in contact'.

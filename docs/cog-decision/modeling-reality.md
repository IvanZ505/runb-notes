# Modeling Reality

## Schemas and Frameworks

- Commonsense/intuitive background knowledge in three domains:
	- **Biology**
	- **Physics**
	- **Psychology**
- Develop early in life.
- Organize our understanding of new information.
	- **Elizabeth Spelke** argues that there are at least six innate systems of "core knowledge" that support intuitions

#### Schema Theories
- Schemas are **general knowledge** about what you have **learned** to expect.
- We rely on stored background knowledge, activated by even a single word, to make sense of new info.
- Content of schemas guides how we make sense of current situations.

> These schemas can influence learning and performance...


**Entity Theory**: Intelligence is a fixed trait.

**Increment Theory:** Intelligence is a flexible trait.

##### Study (Brickwell)
- 7th graders who held entity theory tended to explain setbacks by thinking they were not good at that thing and gave up.
- 7th graders who held incremental theory tended to explain setbacks by thinking they didn't work hard enough and tried different strategies.
- Although students with the entity and increment theories did not differ significantly in their math achievement scores as they entered junior high, but diverged over subsequent 2 years of junior high.

#### Scripts
- Scripts are sets of general knowledge for a **routine event**
- Scripts are picked up over time by observation, and our memories of them make it possible for us to quickly understand and know what to expect in many routine types of situations.

##### Script Violations
- Violations of scripts make stories more interesting since they fail to meet our expectations (Bower et al 1979):
	- Errors (order coffee, are served spaghetti)
	- Obstacles (no server, unable to order food)
	- Distractions (car towed, run out of restaurants)
- When presented with stories, script violations (especially obstacles and distractions) are remembered better than script-consistent components.

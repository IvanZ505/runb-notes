# Modeling Reality

## Schemas and Frameworks

- Commonsense/intuitive background knowledge in three domains:
	- **Biology**
	- **Physics**
	- **Psychology**
- Develop early in life.
- Organize our understanding of new information.
	- **Elizabeth Spelke** argues that there are at least six innate systems of "core knowledge" that support intuitions

#### Schema Theories
- Schemas are **general knowledge** about what you have **learned** to expect.
- We rely on stored background knowledge, activated by even a single word, to make sense of new info.
- Content of schemas guides how we make sense of current situations.

> These schemas can influence learning and performance...


**Entity Theory**: Intelligence is a fixed trait.

**Increment Theory:** Intelligence is a flexible trait.

##### Study (Brickwell)
- 7th graders who held entity theory tended to explain setbacks by thinking they were not good at that thing and gave up.
- 7th graders who held incremental theory tended to explain setbacks by thinking they didn't work hard enough and tried different strategies.
- Although students with the entity and increment theories did not differ significantly in their math achievement scores as they entered junior high, but diverged over subsequent 2 years of junior high.

#### Scripts
- Scripts are sets of general knowledge for a **routine event**
- Scripts are picked up over time by observation, and our memories of them make it possible for us to quickly understand and know what to expect in many routine types of situations.

##### Script Violations
- Violations of scripts make stories more interesting since they fail to meet our expectations (Bower et al 1979):
	- Errors (order coffee, are served spaghetti)
	- Obstacles (no server, unable to order food)
	- Distractions (car towed, run out of restaurants)
- When presented with stories, script violations (especially obstacles and distractions) are remembered better than script-consistent components.

## Hypothesis Testing
- Originally called a "*bias towards verification*"
- Wason did not claim that participants desire to show that the rule was true.
- This would be odd, since the rule is abstract and arbitrarily chosen.
- Instead, he claimed that participants rely on a positive test strategy to examine whether the rule is true.

### Positive Test Strategy
- Examine instances in which the property or event is expected to occur (to see if it does occur)
- Examine instances in which it is known to have occurred (to see if the hypothesized conditions prevail)

> It is a positive test strategy if **they are only looking for** positive test strategies.

### Karl Popper
- According to Adler's theory: Human actions are motivated by feelings of inferiority.
- Now consider the following case: A man is standing on the bank and the instant a child falls into the river nearby. The man leaps into the river in an attempt to save the child.
	- Adler can use the theory to explain this by saying: the man needed to overcome his feeling of inferiority by demonstrating that he was brave.
	- Now, if he did not jump, Adler can also use this theory to offer the explanation: The man had a feeling of inferiority that led him to think he is not the kind of person who could do something heroic like saving a child.

- Popper noted that by making a testable prediction, the general theory of relativity was put at risk.
- Popper drew the moral that genuine scientific theories are falsifiable.
- Theories are not derived by induction. They are tentative conjectures that attempt to solve problems.

### Forensics
- Mayfield case where someone was falsely convicted of bombing Madrid trains.
- When the Spanish police identified a different match for the fingerprint, the FBI also agreed with them, and started to identify things that were not actually there.

### Medicine
- In trying to make a diagnosis, clinicians may first formulate a rough preliminary evaluation and then search in a confirmatory manner for the features that would support that diagnosis.
- Study with medical interns and physicians at 3 psychiatric hospitals.

#### What they did
- A case vignette was presented to the subjects:
	- Mr L (64 yrs old) is delievered to your clinic by the EMS. He seems to be heavily sedated and the physician's referral note states "suspicion of overdose on sleeping pills."
	- By the next day, Mr L is now fully alert and tells you that he is usually a fun and happy person, but recently has been on the brink of tears.
	- Mr L is neat in appearance and well kempt but seems quite dejected.
- They could ask for 12 more pieces of information that would help confirm either depression or alzheimers.

### Reason Based Choice
- When people have weak or conflicting intuitions, they tend to make the decision for which it is easiest to find reasons- the decisions that they can best justify.

#### Myside bias
- A tendency to find arguments that defend one's position or refuting a position one disagrees with.

**Biased assimilation** of evidence:

- Remember strengths of confirming evidence but weaknesses of disconfirming evidence.
- Biased assimilation can lead to **polarization**.
- Through biased assimilation even...

#### Magical Contagion Effect
- Objects can acquire the "essence" of a source through physical contact with that source.
- Sometimes described as a contagion heuristic: 'once in contact, always in contact'.

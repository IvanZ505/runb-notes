# Cognitive Science of Smell

- Taught by Dr. [John P. McGann](mailto:john.mcgann@rutgers.edu)

## Course Goal

- To use smell as a venue to explore larger questions in cognitive science, including perception, learning, language, attention, information representation, neurobiology, and decision-making.
- To learn about smell for its own sake, including its rich role in human health, eating and social communication, and some of the underlying science around food and aroma perception.
- To develop your skills in the ciritcal analysis of cognitive scientific ideas and data interpretation.
- To build our Rutgers community of scholars including enjoying our time together.

## What is a Smell

> ***Smell*** is a colloquial term for both the chemicals in your nose and the percept they evoke.


- **Odorant** is the scientific word for the chemicals in your nose that evoke the olfactory sensation.
	- They vary in chemical structure!
- #todo missing something

### Odorants
- Odorants are detected by proteins called **odor receptors** expressed in the *olfactory sensory neurons (OSMs)* in your nose.
- Part of these receptors stick out of the outside of the OSNs #todo huh

#### Combinatorial Code

- Each kind of odor receptor is sensitive to particular chemical features of the odorant molecuel, so any given odorant will activate only a particular set of odor receptors.
- This makes a **combinatorial code** #todo fetch

#### Odorant Chemicals

- Many chemical factors determine what odorsants get into the air, into the nose, and onto an odor receptor.
- **Volatility** is the general tendency for an odorant to diffuse into the air from a solid or liquid source. More volatile compounds get more molecules airborne than less volatile compounds.

#### Odorant Chemistry

> **Solubility**, which is essentially how easy an odorant is to dissolve in a medium, is an essential basis of odorant chemistry.

- Odorants that are highly soluble are easily absorbed iun the nose, so they tend to smell more strongly relative to their concentration in the air.
- Highly soluble odorants are easier to get out of their source material, so they tend to put more odorant into the air.

> The Solubility depends on the odorant AND the medium (the material it's being dissolved in, like air or water)

- Some chemicals are *lipophilic*, which means they are more soluble in oil than in water. They tend to be fatty, non-polar molecules themselves, such as fat, vitamins, and hormones.
- Some chemical are *hydrophilic*, which means they are more soluble in water than in oil. They tend to be polar molecules like salt, sugar, and alcohol.

- Odorants reach a particular *equilibrium* in a given container, where the repulsion of the molecules in the air balances the repulsion oft he molecules int he odorant source.
- The concentration of odorants in the air that achieves this equilibrium is called the vapor pressure. each volatile chemical has a characteristic vapor pressure, which determines how many molecules it wants to put into the air. High vapor pressure odorants tend to smell stronger than low vapor pressure odorants because they emit more molecules. (and are thus more volatile)
- Given enough time and surface area, the headspace of air over an odorant in a container will stabilize at a concentration determined by that odorant's vapor pressure... #todo blah

##### Summary

- Vapor pressure depends on the:
	- **Identity** of the odorant.
	- **Temperature** (higher temps mean higher vapor pressure)
	- **Pressure** (Lower headspace pressure means more vapor pressure)
- Because temperature determines how volatile a given odorant is, an odorant mixture can smell different at different temperatures and altitudes.
	- The food industry sometimes has specialized chemists that adjust their product for different markets.

### Odorant Extraction

> **Aromatics** refers to the chemical components of a natural product (e.g. a pine tree or a vanilla bean) that compose its odor.

- N.B. This is actually unrelated to aromaticity in organic chemistry.

- **Extraction** is the process of removing aromatics from the natural product so we can smell them or store them.


#### Methods

> Your food has flavor because chewing causes the odors in the food to go up the back of your mouth.

- *Mechanical* extraction, such as grinding, squeezing, or maceration.
	- *Chewing* is a form of mechanical extraction, resulting in odorants that reach our noses retronasally.
	- *Pressing* lemon or orange skin expresses some of their aromatic oils.


- *Solvent extraction*
	- We do this all the time with *water* or *ethanol*.
		- Making soup is a form of solvent extraction of aromatics from your spices (which is temp dependent)
		- Soaking vanilla beans in alcohol is form of solvent extraction.
		- This is safe but limited util.
	- The flavor and fragrance industry uses highly volatile *hydrocarbon solvents* like ether and pentane to extract some aromatics while leaving undesirable compounds behind. Then you can just let the solvent evaporate and the aromatics are left behind.
		- This is how dry cleaning works!
		- Works great but can extract compounds that you don't want. (You also need to make sure that non of the toxic solvent is left behind *especially in food products*)
		- The ultimate is *supercritical carbon dioxide extraction*, which requires high pressure and flow but is safe and works well for botanicals.

- *Steam extraction and distillation*
	- Uses steam to break the cell walls of plants and carry away odorant molecules, then use condensation to retrieve the molecules out of the steam.
	- Technologically simple and old-fashioned but still works great for botanical extractions.
	- Very effective for water soluble (e.g. hydrophilic) aromatics and somewhat effective as a carrier for lipophilic aromatics.
		- The aromatics don't need to be absorbed by the water, merely to have some vapor pressure of their own at 100C, then the steam will carry the vapor to the condenser.

## Food

### Flavor vs Taste vs Smell

> We are always misusing the word "taste".

- **Flavor:** The multimodal sensation associated with food or drink in the mouth.
	- Integrated mental construct which includes:
		- Retronasal smell (banana, hamburger)
		- Taste (e.g. sour, salty)
		- Somatosensation (e.g. creamy, cold)
		- Trigeminal stimulation (e.g. spicy, hot)
		- Astringency (e.g. pucker)
- **Taste:** #todo ikfhjasdoifasoifas

> Orthonasal - the normal way. Retronasal - back of your mouth.

#### Retronasal Olfactory Sensation

- The sansation of an odor that is perceived when chewing and swalling force an odorant in the mouth up behind the palate into the nose.
	- Such odor sensations are perceived as originating from the mouth, even though the actual contact of odorant and receptor occurs at the olfactory mucosa.

#### Orthonasal Olfactory Sensation

- The sensation of an odor that is perceived when entering the nose through the nostrils (aka nares).
- Orthonasal and retronasal smell often differs markedly in palatability (e.g. cut grass).

## T-Test

> Also known as student's t-test


- The fundamental underpinning and statistical test in psych, biomedical research.
- It was invented by the Guinness brewing company.
	- Needed to solve a QOL problem.
	- Something about barley and sinking and floating.
- The T-Test is a test of how many tests would make you confident that the batch is above or below your cutoff.
- T-test only works on *normal* data.

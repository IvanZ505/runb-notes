# Cognitive Science of Smell

- Taught by Dr. [John P. McGann](mailto:john.mcgann@rutgers.edu)

## Course Goal

- To use smell as a venue to explore larger questions in cognitive science, including perception, learning, language, attention, information representation, neurobiology, and decision-making.
- To learn about smell for its own sake, including its rich role in human health, eating and social communication, and some of the underlying science around food and aroma perception.
- To develop your skills in the ciritcal analysis of cognitive scientific ideas and data interpretation.
- To build our Rutgers community of scholars including enjoying our time together.

## Why Study the Olfactory System?

		- Axon-less neurons

## Olfactory System and Neuroplasticity

### Cognitive influences in smell start at the beginning

- **Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Processing**
    - Metaphorical Sense – “raw” sensory information vs “information-added” sensory information
    - Anatomical Sense – “ascending projections” from physically lower sensory regions vs “descending projections” from physically higher regions
- **The DIRTY SECRET of sensory neurobiology…**
    - Descending projections outnumber ascending projections (at least in mammalian sensory systems)
- **Top-down connections dominate mammalian sensory circuits**
    
    - Descending projections outnumber ascending projections in mammalian sensory systems
    - Visual system (V1 to LGN in thalamus)
    - Auditory system (auditory cortex to MGN in thalamus)
    - Somatosensory system (S1 to gracile and cuneate nuclei in brainstem)
    - Olfactory system (olfactory cortex to the olfactory bulb)
        
- **Why don’t we know what descending projections do?**
    
    - Anesthesia shuts down “higher” brain function
    - Access: The convergence of ascending & descending projections typically first occurs in thalamus and brainstem.
    - Interpretation: Feedback loops are hard to understand.

> “Whilst one part of what we perceive comes through our sense from the object before us, another part (and it may be the larger part) always comes out of our own head.” - William James (1890)

#### Poor Human Olfaction is a 19th Century Myth

- **Gross anatomy of the olfactory system**
- **Comparative anatomy of the olfactory bulb**
- **Paul Broca and Human Olfaction**
    - Neurosurgeon & Neuroscientist
    - Broca’s area & Broca’s aphasia
    - Anthropologist
    - Subversive…?
- **Broca classified humans as “anosmatiques”**
    - Small relative size of human bulb
    - Believed humans have free will
    - NOT based on sensory testing
- **Human olfaction is widely believed to be very poor**
    - Sir William Turner (1890) reclassified humans from “anosmatic” to “microsmatic”
    - Sigmund Freud (1909) linked olfaction loss to sexual repression
    - Herrick (1924) stated that humans’ olfactory organs are “greatly reduced, almost vestigial”
    - Sir Victor Negus (1958) claimed “the human mind is an inadequate agent with which to study olfaction”

### What’s bigger, the human bulb or mouse bulb?

- **So should we worry about relative size or absolute size?**
    - Evolutionary theory has settled on basic rules of brain scaling:
        - Brain region sizes correlate and scale predictably… EXCEPT for the olfactory regions.
        - Olfactory bulbs can grow/shrink over the lifespan without neuron number changes.
        - **Mammals have about 10 million olfactory bulb neurons, regardless of species!**

### Human Olfactory Abilities

- **Human olfactory sensitivity is excellent**
    - Humans can detect an extraordinarily wide range of odors.
    - Our sensitivity depends on the odor, but we are in the mix with other mammals for “best smeller…”
- **Human olfaction is excellent and impactful**
    - Humans communicate information about individual genetics, diet, and emotional state through olfactory cues.
    - Loss of olfactory abilities significantly impacts human health, notably mental health.
    - Adults (age 40-65) with altered smell are 64% more likely to have clinical depression diagnosis.
    - Our perception of flavor is dominated by retronasal smell.

### What factors affect your sense of smell?

- **Age!** 50% of people over age 65 exhibit an olfactory deficit
- **Gender** Women are a little bit more sensitive than men, on average, even in newborns
- **Smoking** Non-smokers have better sensitivity than smokers
- **Genetics** People differ in their expression of odor receptors in the nose, which is reflected in their olfactory perception.
- **Possibly brain structure…?** Humans have been reported to have very idiosyncratic glomerular structure in their olfactory bulbs

### The rest of the brain matters too…

- **Humans have a hugely complex cerebral cortex to interpret and shape olfactory signals.**
    - Orbitofrontal and piriform cortices
    - Odors exist within a contextual semantic network
    - These probably add distinctively human richness and meaning to odors.
- **Humans and other mammals are all using similar olfactory hardware and trying to understand roughly the same olfactory world.**
- **The dynamic power of smell enables humans and other animals to understand our worlds together.**

## What is a Smell

> ***Smell*** is a colloquial term for both the chemicals in your nose and the percept they evoke.


- **Odorant** is the scientific word for the chemicals in your nose that evoke the olfactory sensation.
	- They vary in chemical structure!
- Scientists sometimes use the word _“smell”_ colloquially and sometimes to refer specifically to the olfactory percept.

### Odorants
- Odorants are detected by proteins called **odor receptors** expressed in the *olfactory sensory neurons (OSMs)* in your nose.
- Part of these receptors stick out of the outside of the OSNs membrane, bind odorants, and trigger a signal cascade that excites the neuron.
- - _Buck and Axel shared the Nobel Prize for this in 2004._
- The **OR51E2 receptor** (shown right) binds the odorant **propionic acid** (orange).
    - _(Billesbølle et al. 2023)_ [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05798-y)


#### Combinatorial Code

- Each kind of odor receptor is sensitive to particular chemical features of the odorant molecule, so any given odorant will activate only a particular set of odor receptors.
- Each odor receptor is **sensitive to specific chemical features**.
- Any given odorant **activates a particular set of odor receptors**.
- This creates a **combinatorial code**, where:
    - The **odorant’s chemical structure** determines which receptors are stimulated.
    - The **set of responsive receptors** conveys the odor’s identity.
    - _(PubMed: [10089886](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10089886/))_

### Complexity of Smells

>  Most "smells" are actually **mixtures of multiple odorants**.

- Example: **Coffee**
    - Contains **~850 volatile chemicals**.
    - Only **~40 have distinct smells**.
    - **~28 are essential** to recreate the coffee smell.
    - _(Belitz et al. 2009)_ [Link](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-69934-7)
- Even within a single smell, **odorant composition varies**.
    - Example: **Balsam fir oil**
    - Individual samples show **different max/min values of odorants**.
    - _(Régimbal & Collin, 1994)_


### Odorant Chemistry

- Many chemical factors determine what odorants get into the air, into the nose, and onto an odor receptor.
- **Volatility** is the general tendency for an odorant to diffuse into the air from a solid or liquid source. More volatile compounds get more molecules airborne than less volatile compounds.

#### Volatility and Diffusion
- **Volatility** = How easily an odorant evaporates into the air.
    - More **volatile** → More molecules airborne → **Stronger smell**
- **Diffusion** = Odorants **spread evenly** through the air.
    - Driven by **London dispersion forces** (quantum mechanics concepts).

---

#### Vapor Pressure & Equilibrium

- **Odorants reach equilibrium** in the air when repulsion forces balance.
- **Vapor pressure** = The concentration of odorant in air at equilibrium.
- **Higher vapor pressure** → Stronger-smelling odorant.
- Given enough time, a **saturated vapor** forms in a closed space.

---

#### Factors Affecting Vapor Pressure

- **Odorant identity**
- **Temperature** (_higher temp → higher vapor pressure_)
- **Pressure** (_lower air pressure → higher vapor pressure_)
- **Ideal Gas Law**: _PV = nRT_ (basic chemistry concept)
- **Real-world impact**:
    - Odor mixtures **smell different at different temperatures/altitudes**.
    - **Food industry** adjusts recipes for different markets.

---

### Sorption & Nasal Mucosa

- **Odorants must dissolve into nasal mucosa** to be detected.
- **Sorption efficiency** varies across odorants.
- Airflow speed **affects how odorants distribute in the nose**.
- **Max Mozell (1970)** demonstrated using a **frog’s nose as a chromatograph**!
    - _(PubMed: [5514160](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5514160/))_

#### Solubility and Odorant Extraction

> **Solubility**, which is essentially how easy an odorant is to dissolve in a medium, is an essential basis of odorant chemistry.

- Odorants that are highly soluble are easily absorbed in the nose, so they tend to smell more strongly relative to their concentration in the air.
- Highly soluble odorants are easier to get out of their source material, so they tend to put more odorant into the air.

> The Solubility depends on the odorant AND the medium (the material it's being dissolved in, like air or water)

- Some chemicals are *lipophilic*, which means they are more soluble in oil than in water. They tend to be fatty, non-polar molecules themselves, such as fat, vitamins, and hormones.
- Some chemical are *hydrophilic*, which means they are more soluble in water than in oil. They tend to be polar molecules like salt, sugar, and alcohol.

- Odorants reach a particular *equilibrium* in a given container, where the repulsion of the molecules in the air balances the repulsion oft he molecules int he odorant source.
- The concentration of odorants in the air that achieves this equilibrium is called the vapor pressure. each volatile chemical has a characteristic vapor pressure, which determines how many molecules it wants to put into the air. High vapor pressure odorants tend to smell stronger than low vapor pressure odorants because they emit more molecules. (and are thus more volatile)
- Given enough time and surface area, the headspace of air over an odorant in a container will stabilize at a concentration determined by that odorant's vapor pressure...

> In short:

- **Solubility** = How easily an odorant dissolves in a medium.
- **Hydrophilic compounds** = dissolve in **water** (e.g., salt, sugar, alcohol).
- **Lipophilic compounds** = dissolve in **oil** (e.g., fat, vitamins, hormones).
- **Solubility affects odor perception in two key ways**:
    1. **Odorant extraction** from food/materials (_chewing, cooking, chemical processing_).
    2. **Nasal sorption**:
        - Hydrophilic odorants dissolve easily in mucus.
        - Lipophilic odorants require **odorant-binding proteins**.
- **Essential oils** = Lipophilic odorants extracted from natural sources.
- **Hydrosols** = Water-based extracts containing hydrophilic compounds.

### Autoassociation: Learning Odorant Combinations

![](imgs/Pasted%20image%2020250226182616.png)

#### The Problem: Pattern Recognition

- The brain must **combine related odor inputs**:
    - **Integrate** odor receptor responses to identify an individual odorant (_e.g., methylpropanal_).
    - **Integrate** multiple odorants to recognize a complex smell (_e.g., coffee_).
- The brain must also **separate different smells**:
    - Example: A **bakery** should still smell like _coffee_, _donuts_, and _bread_—not just a jumbled mixture.
- **AI connection**: This is the same **pattern recognition** problem faced by machine learning systems.
- **Hinton & Hopfield (2024 Nobel Prize in Physics)**
    - Developed **autoassociation** models for machine learning.
    - **Hopfield’s 1991 model** explains how the olfactory system could solve this.

---

### Autoassociator Model: How the Brain Learns Smells

- **Key features**:
    - Trained on **co-occurring inputs**.
    - When given **partial input**, it **reconstructs the full pattern**.
    - **Content-addressable storage**: No need for memory locations—just provide a fragment, and it completes the pattern.
    - **Distributed storage**: Information is **spread across many connections** in the network.
- **Demonstration setup**:
    - **All outputs loop back to inputs**.
    - **All activity is binary** (on/off).
    - **Any input can activate a neuron**.
    - **Simultaneous pre- & post-synaptic activity** strengthens connections.

---

##### Example: Autoassociator State Changes

- Before smelling banana:
	- Randomized network state.

- After smelling banana:
	- Pattern learned and stored.
- After smelling diesel & banana:
	- Network recognizes **banana + diesel** separately, while still linking banana to its stored pattern.

##### Summary

- Vapor pressure depends on the:
	- **Identity** of the odorant.
	- **Temperature** (higher temps mean higher vapor pressure)
	- **Pressure** (Lower headspace pressure means more vapor pressure)
- Because temperature determines how volatile a given odorant is, an odorant mixture can smell different at different temperatures and altitudes.
	- The food industry sometimes has specialized chemists that adjust their product for different markets.

### Odorant Extraction

> **Aromatics** refers to the chemical components of a natural product (e.g. a pine tree or a vanilla bean) that compose its odor.

- N.B. This is actually unrelated to aromaticity in organic chemistry.

- **Extraction** is the process of removing aromatics from the natural product so we can smell them or store them.


#### Methods

> Your food has flavor because chewing causes the odors in the food to go up the back of your mouth.

- *Mechanical* extraction, such as grinding, squeezing, or maceration.
	- *Chewing* is a form of mechanical extraction, resulting in odorants that reach our noses retronasally.
	- *Pressing* lemon or orange skin expresses some of their aromatic oils.


- *Solvent extraction*
	- We do this all the time with *water* or *ethanol*.
		- Making soup is a form of solvent extraction of aromatics from your spices (which is temp dependent)
		- Soaking vanilla beans in alcohol is form of solvent extraction.
		- This is safe but limited util.
	- The flavor and fragrance industry uses highly volatile *hydrocarbon solvents* like ether and pentane to extract some aromatics while leaving undesirable compounds behind. Then you can just let the solvent evaporate and the aromatics are left behind.
		- This is how dry cleaning works!
		- Works great but can extract compounds that you don't want. (You also need to make sure that non of the toxic solvent is left behind *especially in food products*)
		- The ultimate is *supercritical carbon dioxide extraction*, which requires high pressure and flow but is safe and works well for botanicals.

- *Steam extraction and distillation*
	- Uses steam to break the cell walls of plants and carry away odorant molecules, then use condensation to retrieve the molecules out of the steam.
	- Technologically simple and old-fashioned but still works great for botanical extractions.
	- Very effective for water soluble (e.g. hydrophilic) aromatics and somewhat effective as a carrier for lipophilic aromatics.
		- The aromatics don't need to be absorbed by the water, merely to have some vapor pressure of their own at 100C, then the steam will carry the vapor to the condenser.

## Food

### Flavor vs Taste vs Smell

> We are always misusing the word "taste".

- **Flavor:** The multimodal sensation associated with food or drink in the mouth.
	- Integrated mental construct which includes:
		- Retronasal smell (banana, hamburger)
		- Taste (e.g. sour, salty)
		- Somatosensation (e.g. creamy, cold)
		- Trigeminal stimulation (e.g. spicy, hot)
		- Astringency (e.g. pucker)
> Orthonasal - the normal way. Retronasal - back of your mouth.

#### Retronasal Olfactory Sensation

- The sansation of an odor that is perceived when chewing and swalling force an odorant in the mouth up behind the palate into the nose.
	- Such odor sensations are perceived as originating from the mouth, even though the actual contact of odorant and receptor occurs at the olfactory mucosa.

#### Orthonasal Olfactory Sensation

- The sensation of an odor that is perceived when entering the nose through the nostrils (aka nares).
- Orthonasal and retronasal smell often differs markedly in palatability (e.g. cut grass).

## Food Perception

### Flavor vs. Taste vs. Smell

- **Flavor**: The **multimodal sensation** associated with food or drink in the mouth.
    - Includes:
        - **Retronasal smell** (e.g., banana, hamburger)
        - **Taste** (e.g., sour, salty)
        - **Somatosensation** (e.g., creamy, cold)
        - **Trigeminal stimulation** (e.g., spicy hot)
        - **Astringency** (e.g., pucker)
- **Taste**: The sensations **arising specifically from the taste buds** in the mouth, including:
    - **Sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami**
- **Smell**: The sensations **arising from the nose**, whether **orthonasal** or **retronasal**.
    
---

### Retronasal vs. Orthonasal Smell

- **Retronasal olfactory sensation**:
    - Perceived when **chewing and swallowing** forces an odorant from the mouth **up behind the palate** into the nose.
    - These smells **seem to originate from the mouth**, even though they are detected in the **olfactory mucosa**.
- **Orthonasal olfactory sensation**:
    - Perceived when an odor **enters the nose through the nostrils (nares)**.
- **Key difference**:
    - **Orthonasal and retronasal perception often differ in palatability** (e.g., cut grass).

---

### Demonstration: The Jelly Bean Test
- Some foods have **strong retronasal smells** but **not strong orthonasal smells**.
- Example: Certain candies and foods have **muted odors when sniffed but strong flavors when eaten**.

---

### Food Perception & Industry
- **Food perception** is the subject of extensive **industry research**, especially in **New Jersey**.
- In commercial settings, this field is often called **"sensory science."**
- A clear **application of cognitive science**, especially basic research.

---

### Neurogastronomy

    - **Liquid nitrogen freezing** (e.g., shattering ingredients, making unusual ice creams)
    - **Dehydration & Powdering**
    - **Spherification**
    - **Meat glues**
- The term **"molecular cuisine"** refers to the **cooking style** explicitly derived from **molecular gastronomy**.
- **Alinea (Chicago, 3 Michelin stars)** is the **most famous restaurant** using molecular cuisine.
    

---

### Top-Down Influences on Food Perception

- While today's discussion focuses on **bottom-up factors** in food & odor perception, **top-down effects** are also crucial.
- **McCall et al. (2004)**:
    - Showed that **Pepsi vs. Coke** evoked **different preferences & fMRI patterns** when labeled, but **not when served blindly**.
    - **Marketing acts like an ingredient**—it **alters flavor perception**.
- **Expectations, social factors, and cognitive influences** shape food perception.
    

---

### Odor Release in Food Consumption
- Most foods release **distinct odorant molecules**:
    - **Before consumption** (_orthonasal smell_).
    - **During consumption** (_retronasal smell_).
- Most foods are composed of **dozens to hundreds of different odorants**.
- The **food industry** constantly works to improve flavor replication by:
    - **Extracting flavor compounds** (_challenging due to chemistry_).
    - **Synthesizing and blending flavor components**.

## Vanilla: Biology and Chemistry

### Vanilla Biology and Production

- **Vanilla** is a **tropical orchid** prized for its **aromatic fruit (“bean”)**.
- It is the **most popular odor in the world**.

---

#### Challenges in Vanilla Cultivation

- **Difficult to grow**:
    - Requires **high humidity & consistent hot temperatures**.
    - Climbing vine → Needs **supporting trees or structures**.
    - Requires **mycorrhizal fungi** on roots for symbiosis.
- **Pollination issues**:
    - Cannot be easily pollinated, even by **orchid bees**.
    - Indigenous to **Mexico**, but pollinating bees live **only in Mexico**, not in Africa or Polynesia (where most plantations are).
    - **Solution:**
        - **Hand pollination**: Workers use **a stick** to self-pollinate vanilla orchids.
        - Orchid flowers must be pollinated **within 12 hours of blooming**.
- **Harvesting & Growth**:
    - **9 months** from pollination to mature vanilla bean pod.
    - **Vanilla sap** can trigger **allergic reactions** in workers.

---

#### Vanilla Processing & Curing

    1. **Killing**: Heated in **hot water bath** to trigger **vanillin-generating enzymes**.
    2. **Sweating**: Wrapped in **fabric** to let enzymes work for **one week**.
    3. **Drying**: **One month** in the sun.
    4. **Conditioning**: **Six months** in storage.
- **Challenges in processing**: (they are highly variable)
    - Vanilla pods are **not synchronized**, requiring **individual hand-harvesting**.
    - Beans **respond differently** to the curing process.

## Changing Sensory Systems

- The changing of sensory systems could be useful if you want to *optimize* the function for a particular environment or goal.
- Or, to more effectively link sensory input to attention, affect, motivated behavior, etc...

#### Adaptive Responses

> Sensory changes to adjust to stimuli as they are encountered.

- *Example:* Pupillary responses.

#### Anticipatory Responses

> Sensory changes that occur when a stimulus is expected.

- *Example:* Priming based illusions.
- *Example:* Interpreting sound sources.

#### Ongoing Responses

> Sensory changes that last indefinitely.

- *Example:* Recognition based illusions.

- **Postulation**: Sensory dynamics have a *cognitive* component in so far as they apply *pre-existing information* about the world to better interpret sensory input **or** couple sensory input to behavior.
- If this is indeed true, this means that:
	- We should see beliefs about the world reflected in sensory processing, maybe even beliefs that are *incorrect.*
- Cognitive *dysfunction* might be expected to manifest in particular forms of *sensory dysfunction*.

### What if an Odor Becomes Common?

![](imgs/Pasted%20image%2020250505162600.png)

- This is a change in neural representations based on *learned* natural statistics about odors.

### What if it Predicts Shock

- **Discriminative** fear conditioning yields odor-specific fear and odor-specific increases in OSN output.

> This is a change in neural representations based on *learned* odor-shock contingencies. Why could that be useful?

### What if the Mouse *Thinks* an Odor Predicts a Shock

- Single-odor conditioning yields generalization in OSNs (Olfactory sensory neurons).

> This is a change in neural representations based on *inferred* odor-shock contingencies. Why could that be useful?

- *Single-odor* conditioning yields generalization in the PG cells (periglomerular cells crucial for processing odor info)

> This is a change in neural representations caused by *learning* that occurs during first inhalation.


- **Contingencies**: Why might that timing matter?

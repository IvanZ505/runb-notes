# Cognitive Science of Smell

- Taught by Dr. [John P. McGann](mailto:john.mcgann@rutgers.edu)

## Course Goal

- To use smell as a venue to explore larger questions in cognitive science, including perception, learning, language, attention, information representation, neurobiology, and decision-making.
- To learn about smell for its own sake, including its rich role in human health, eating and social communication, and some of the underlying science around food and aroma perception.
- To develop your skills in the ciritcal analysis of cognitive scientific ideas and data interpretation.
- To build our Rutgers community of scholars including enjoying our time together.

## What is a Smell

> ***Smell*** is a colloquial term for both the chemicals in your nose and the percept they evoke.


- **Odorant** is the scientific word for the chemicals in your nose that evoke the olfactory sensation.
	- They vary in chemical structure!
- #todo missing something

### Odorants
- Odorants are detected by proteins called **odor receptors** expressed in the *olfactory sensory neurons (OSMs)* in your nose.
- Part of these receptors stick out of the outside of the OSNs #todo huh

#### Combinatorial Code

- Each kind of odor receptor is sensitive to particular chemical features of the odorant molecuel, so any given odorant will activate only a particular set of odor receptors.
- This makes a **combinatorial code** #todo fetch

#### Odorant Chemicals

- Many chemical factors determine what odorsants get into the air, into the nose, and onto an odor receptor.
- **Volatility** is the general tendency for an odorant to diffuse into the air from a solid or liquid source. More volatile compounds get more molecules airborne than less volatile compounds.

#### Odorant Chemistry

- Odorants reach a particular *equilibrium* in a given container, where the repulsion of the molecules in the air balances the repulsion oft he molecules int he odorant source.
- The concentration of odorants in the air that achieves this equilibrium is called the vapor pressure. each volatile chemical has a characteristic vapor pressure, which determines how many molecules it wants to put into the air. High vapor pressure odorants tend to smell stronger than low vapor pressure odorants because they emit more molecules. (and are thus more volatile)
- Given enough time and surface area, the headspace of air over an odorant in a container will stabilize at a concentration determined by that odorant's vapor pressure... #todo blah

##### Summary

- Vapor pressure depends on the:
	- **Identity** of the odorant.
	- **Temperature** (higher temps mean higher vapor pressure)
	- **Pressure** (Lower headspace pressure means more vapor pressure)
- Because temperature determines how volatile a given odorant is, an odorant mixture can smell different at different temperatures and altitudes.
	- The food industry sometimes has specialized chemists that adjust their product for different markets.

Week 1
=========

*** Add exam dates and assignments to your calendar. ***

When submitting your assignments there are two places to submit there:

        - AutoLab: For automatically grading coding assignments
        - Gradescope: For written assignments

The CAVE:

        https://resources.cs.rutgers.edu/docs/rooms-equipment/cave/

Algorithm Development:

1. Analyze:
        Understand the problem you are solving.
2. Solve:
        Develope a step by step algo.
        Use a "language" to express it
3. Evaluate:
        Play a human computer to see how the algo works.
        Mistake? Go back to 1 and/or 2.


ALGO RUNTIME: Understand the running time of an algo.


Example:

Inputs: HoursW, wage
Output: Salary

Errors: negative hours, wages less than 1.


```
READ HoursW                             -- 1 operation
READ wages                              -- 1 operation
if(HoursW < 0) or (wages <= 0):         -- 2 operations
        DISPLAY error                   -- 1 operation
else:                                   -- no operations
        HoursW * wages = salary         -- 1 operation
        Sys.out.print(salary)           -- 1 operations
ENDIF                                   -- 0 operations

mod--- % (12 %2 = 0)
```

INCREMENTATION:
----------------

```pseudocode

SET x TO 1			// x is initiated as

WHILE x < 5:		// will work while condition is true 
	DISPLAY x		// Display the number
	INCREMENT x		// Adds one to x
ENDWHILE

```

Taking user input:

```

READ m				// 1 operation

IF m < 1 THEN			// 1 operation
	DISPLAY ERROR		// 1 operation
ELSE
	SET x to 1			//Algorithm Development:

```

PROBLEM: Suppose that we are writing the program for a gas station
pump. The pump has 3 gas types:
	Reg : $2.89
	Premium : $3.70
	SUPER : $4.50
	
The pump accepts cash or credit. If customer pays with card, it is extra 3%.

```py

gas_type = input("Gas Type (Reg, Premium, Super): ")
while gas_type.lower() != "reg" and gas_type.lower() != "premium" and gas_type.lower() != "super":
	print(f"Your gas type was entered inaccurately.\n You entered {gas_type}. \n Please try again.")
	gas_type = input("Gas Type (Reg, Premium, Super): ")
gallons = input("How much gas u want? ")
try:
  gallons = int(gallons)
except ValueError:
  print("Boi get the fuck outta here.")
  exit()
    
while gallons <= 0:
  print(f"U want me to steal yo gas? Gimme {-gallons} gallons bitch.")
  gallons = input("How much gas u want? ")
  gallons = int(gallons)
credit = input("Credit card? Y/N: ")
while credit.lower() != "y" and credit.lower() != "n":
  print(f"You entered {credit}. This is not a choice.")
  credit = input("Credit card? Y/N: ")



def price_calc(gas_type, gallons, is_credit:bool):
	if gas_type.lower() == "reg":
		price = 2.89
	elif gas_type.lower() == "premium":
		price = 3.7
	elif gas_type.lower() == "super":
		price = 4.5
	
	if not is_credit:
		net_price = price * gallons
		print(f"You owe me ${net_price}.")
	else:
		net_price = price * gallons * 1.03
		print(f"You owe me ${net_price}.")
		
if credit.lower() == "y":
	price_calc(gas_type, gallons, is_credit=True)

if credit.lower() == "n":
	price_calc(gas_type, gallons, is_credit=False)

```

PROBLEM: Write a program to find and display all #s divisible by 3 btwn 1 and n.

```

READ n

SET divisor as 3

SET count as 0
SET check as 1

WHILE check < n
	SET num as check%3
	if num == 0:
		INCREMENT count
	ENDIF
	INCREMENT check
ENDWHILE

PRINT count

Week 10

Primitive VS Abstract Data Types:
----
Primitive Data Types:

- There are 8 types of primitive data types.
- int, boolean, double, char, byte, long, short...

Abstract Data Types:

- Can store as much data as necessary.
- String, Picture, Color...

Implementing a Abstract Data Type (OR MAKING A CLASS):
----

To Create a data type:
- You need instance variables. (Cat example: fur color, eye color for cat)
- The constructor, which instantiates the class. (This usually does not have a return type. (The init method) It's usually named the same thing as the class.
- Ok lmao this is just how to create classes. D: I thought it was important.


Week 11
====

Big O:
- Analyzes how fast a program runs in relation to input size
- Notation used to measure the efficiency of a program (both space and time)
- Machine-dependent (isn't a measure of machine speed directly)
- Typically used to find WORST-TIME

Efficiency of Algorithms

- Find a function of the problem size that behaves like the algorithm's actual time requirement.



How to Determine the runtime:

1) Determine the basic operations in a algorithm.
2) Determine the running time of an algorithm by counting its basic operations.
3) Express the running time of an algorithm as a function of the input size.
4) Derive the <i>Complexity Class</i> of an algorithm. 

So basically does it run in CONSTANT TIME, LINEAR TIME, OR EXPONENTIAL TIME.

Operation Counting:

```

int sum = 0			// One operation

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {    // first statement runs once, second statement  
				//and third statement runs n times leading to 2n+2 fromm that.
	sum += i;		// This is another n, now we have 3n+2
}

// In total, we would end up with 3n+3 operations.

```

General Rules of Big O:
1. It ignores constants
2. certain terms "dominate" others (i.e. i^2 gets dominated by i^3)


Constant Time:

x = 5 * (15 + 2)
Big O: 1

Linear Time:

x = 5 * (15 + 2)

for x in  range (0, n):
	print x;

O(1) + O(N) = O(N)

Quadratic Time:

```java

public class Mystery {

	public static int mysteryMethod(int m, int n) {
		
		int var1 = 0;
		int var2 = n;
		while(var2 <= m) {
			var1++;
			var2 += n;
		}
	}

} // O(N)

```

Grade book:

N = number of assignments
M = number of students

gradeBookAverage() Best Case: O(NM) Worst Case: O(NM)
studentAverage() Best Case: O(N) Worst Case: O(N)
assignmentAverage() Best case: O(M) Worst Case: O(M)

Searching Algorithms:
1. Sequential Search:
   1. Sequential search goes through the entire array starting from index 0
   2. Sequential search has a runtime of O(n) in the worst case
   3. On the best case, it would have a runtime of O(1)
2. Binary Search:
   1. Requires a sorted array in order to use
   2. Binary search always takes the index in the middle before comparing the value to be higher or lower
   3. On the worst case, binary search has a runtime of O(logn), significantly faster than sequential
   4. Best case: O(1)

Sorting Algorithms:
1. Selection Sort:
   1. Starts from the beginning of the array and makes the entire array the unsorted region
   2. Designates array[0] as the minimum value for now
   3. Compares the minimum with every other number in the array, replacing it if necessary
   4. Swaps the minimum to the first position of the array
   5. Shrinks the unsorted region
   6. This sorting algorithm has a runtime of O(n^2)
   7. In the best case, this runtime would still have a runtime of O(n^2))
2. Insertion Sort:
   1. Insertion sort shuffles every other item in the array to make room for an entry.
   2. Considers index 0 as part of the sorted section already.
   3. Will compare the entry being sorted with everything else in the sorted array before plopping it down in place.
   4. Continues down the unsorted array until everything is sorted.
   5. Best case: If the array is already sorted O(n), worst case: O(n^2)
3. Merge Sorting:
   1. Breaks down the array into the smallest values by dividing it in half until its just a singular array #
   2. Then it sorts it back up.
   3. Runtime: O(n log n)

Algo Efficiency Test:

1. Finding a number in a unsorted array: Sequential search
2. Finding a number in a sorted array: binary search
3. Sorting an almost sorted array: insertion search
4. Finding a number in an almost sorted array: Sequential search 
5. Finding multiple numbers in a almost sorted array: insertion sort then binary sort
6. Sort an array of random numbers: Merge sort

Big O:
1. Using Merge sort to sort an array of size n, then use binary search to find 10 elements: nlogn
2. Using merge sort to sort an array of size n, then using binary search to find n^2 elements: n^2logn
3. Using a merge sort to sort an array of size n, then use binary search to find (1/2)n elements: nlogn
4. Using merge sort to sort an array of size n, then run sequential search on it: nlogn

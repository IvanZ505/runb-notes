Course Title: CompTIA IT Fundamentals (FC0-U61) Cert Prep 1: Computer Basics, Hardware, and Operating Systems

Description: Learn the fundamentals you need to ace the CompTIA IT Fundamentals (FC0-U61) exam. Passing the exam earns you the ITF+ certification, designed for advanced users considering a career in IT. This certification is a great entry point for novices transitioning to IT prosâ€”and this three-part cert prep series provides "self-help" style guidance that you can use to study for the exam. The first course covers computer basics, hardware, and operating systems. Instructor Scott Jernigan helps you identify the components of a computer, connect devices and peripherals, set up data storage, and recognize the commonalities of different operating systems. In the final chapter, he provides a hands-on demo of setting up a PC and closes with an Ask Me Anything-style video where he answers common questions about PCs.This course was created by Total Seminars. We are pleased to offer this training in our library.We are a CompTIA Partner. As such, we are able to offer CompTIA exam vouchers at a 10% discount.

0:00:54            Understanding how computers work is called computer literacy 

0:01:32            once you understand hwo things work or how it should work, you should be able to understand how things work.

0:00:27            The computer process gets broken down into four stages: Input, processing, output, storage. 

0:01:09            Processing means the computer reads the input and decides what to do.

0:02:25            A local network: A group of computers or network devices that are on the same switch. 

0:02:43            LANs are limited by a relatively small geographic location and are much faster. 

0:03:19            WAN (Wide Area Network) is 2 or more LANs connected over a larger location by two different routers. 

0:03:40            When you combine a ton of LANs and WANs together you get the internet

0:01:17            CPUs are great at doing what you ask it to do without any idea what it meant. 

0:01:40            CPUs have speed and complexity. 

0:01:52            A CPU's speed is measured in hertz

0:00:40            There are 2 ways to cool computer, passive and active 

0:01:23            Passive cooling relies on air using heat sinks to dissipate heat into the air. 

0:02:03            Active cooling uses some device to push or pull heat away from a device such as a fan. 

0:02:37            Liquid cooling uses a radiator filled with fluid that moves around to disappate heat.

0:00:45            DC (Direct current) is what powers computing devices 

0:00:55            Batteries provvide DC power    

0:01:09            All devices need a power converter, which is what a power adapter

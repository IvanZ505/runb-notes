Intro to Information Technology and Informatics
===

## What is technology?


- Typically, people start with the **things** of technology.
- Technology as tools, and machines is a easy and common definition.
- Matches the "bus stop definition".


#### However,
- If a drill drills, and a hammer hammers, without any external force acting on it, it WILL not hammer or drill.

### Technology, is a applied science.
- The person is connected to the machine by the "know how". We ***know how*** to apply the machine to our task.
- By ourselves, we are not able to do anything, but together, with the person and the tool as well as their know how, we form a system, which is the ***know how***.

### What about Autonomous Technologies?
- Even when we talked about autonomous technology, they are still following the idea of an applied science as even for AI tasks, someone still wrote the code for the AI, someone is still telling the AI to do something, etc...

### Information Technology usually has

#### Intended Consequences - Usually Positive
#### Unintentional Consequences - Usually negative

## Future and Retrofuturism

### Futurism:
- The study of social and technological advancement for the purpose of **exploring how people will live and work in the future**.

### Retrofuturism:
- Idea that you would look toward the future from the perspective of the past.
- Inaccurate and incomplete, they were futuristic when they were published.

### Why is Predicting the Future so Difficult?

### Moore's Law:
- Connects what we are learning today to the future.
- Moore's Law states that every two years, the number of transistors in electronics doubled.

### Narrow AI, Weak AI
- Trained to perform a specific task.
- Can only perform one thing (or a specific set of things) very well.
- Narrow scope of expertise.
- Example: A roomba, the recommendation systems

### The In Between:
- Trained to perform a specific set of things.
- Somewhere in between smart and weak AI.
- Example: Spot the robot dog from Boston Dynamics.

### Generalized AI, Strong AI
- Ability to learn  and adapt to new situations.
- Can perform a wide range of tasks at or near a human-like level.
- Can understand and adapt to broad, complex, unanticipated experiences.

Ray Kurzweil: The Coming Singularity
- Futurist
- Technological Singularity: "a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes irreversible, resulting in unforseen changes to human civilization."

## Rules of interaction in Human and Technological Networks


### What is TCP/IP?
- (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)
- TCP/IP and OSI model are used interchangeably in ITI
- TCP/IP is a set of rules designed for computers to follow in order to communicate.
- All implementations of the TCP/IP Model rely on something called encapsulation.
	- Encapsulation: Allows any device to transmit data through any physical connection that allows for conduction of electricity or transmit a signal. For more see [Encapsulation](#encapsulation).

### Packets
- Packets are wrapped in something called a header
- The headers contains the source and the destinations for the data packets.
- TCP sequence numbers allow re-assembly in order even if the packets do not all arrive in the same order.
- Packets being small and having many of them allows for the system to not collapse if one of the packets got caught in a slow or broken server.

#### DARPA headquarters started the ARPAnet, which was the first "internet".

### Technical Rules vs Sociotechnical Rules
- TCP/IP is a series of rules governing how computers must communicate on the Internet.
- The architectural rules of the internet can not define how humans interact on the internet.
- Thus, we need rules to regulate how people can talk on the internet...

### Andrew Blum Video

### IoT (Internet of Things) Devices
- IOT devices are devices that typically do not have internet access that was GIVEN internet access. (Ex: A smart toaster. Toasters don't have internet access typically)

## The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

- **The OSI Model** is just a  reference model, and so is the **TCP/IP** model. 
- It is a conceptual model that provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection.
- The more you adhere to these standards, the easier time you will have  connecting to the internet.
- Remember it by the acronym:
	- **A**ll **P**eople **S**eem **T**o **N**eed **D**ata **P**rocessing.

![Osi Model](imgs/osi_model.png)

## The Common Protocols in the Application Layer
- These are all application level protocols.

#### HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Used to manage **HyperLinks**.
- Originally proposed to help solve the information management of Data at CERN.
- What's important aboout hypertext is not just the **Text** but the ***links***.
- We didn't have a technology for hypertext prior to this.

## Does the Web Really Want to be Free?

What do models do?

- Models are used to provide an overview, or set a blueprint for how something **should** look or behave.
- No models actually exist in the world. They are just layouts to be implemented.

### Encapsulation
- Each layer does not care what the other layers do, so if a physical layer does do it's job, none of the other layers care.
- As data comes in from the bottom of the stack and gets passed up to whatever app you're using, the inverse is true.
- This means that you will not have to care about which physical address someone else is on or any of those things.

### Netchoice v. Paxton Video Lesson

#### A Sociotechnical Theory of Regulation

**Regulation**: Factors that constrain and enable behaviors.

1. ***Legal Constraints***: A societies laws that constrain and enable your behavior.
2. ***Social Norms***: The rules and expectations of a society that constrian and enable your behavior. (These laws may not land you in jail, but is frowned upon by society.)
3. ***Market Forces***: Financial factors, costs and pricing rules that constrain and enable your behavior.
4. ***Architecture***: HOw things are designed to constrain and enable your behavior. (Refers to architecture of the physical *and* digital kind)

So, to explain the rules that govern speech online, we typically refer to multiple regulations and how they interact.

We call this:

#### Sociotechnical Complexity
- How technological and non-technological regulators often interact to regulate behavior.
	- In order to describe your internet bill, you would need to describe the laws and taxes and how they interact in order to explain it.
	- Another example is how laws enabled 5G technology and the financial interests that companies had to implement it.

---

NetChoice, LLC v. Paxton is the government's attempt to implement laws that govern how people must communicate.
- It is about how **you** get to decide what can or cannot be said in your online community.
- It's not about whether someone is allowed to spout hate speech online, but about whether companies are allowed to regulate them.

#### Netchoice v. Paxton Case
- A Texas law attempts to tell social media companies that they cannot regulate content on their platforms.
- In theory, any state that is in the 5th Circuit of the United States, can now compel any speech it wants on private property, which also includes your home.
- Allows anyone to sue you if you removed content in your private community. (You can not block any viewpoint)


But...

#### Section 230 of Communication Decency Act
- You are not the author of the comments that your user posts.
- It allows you to clean up your own mess on your platforms.
	- So that no platform is responsible for what their people say.

However...

The 5th Circuit courts have already upheld this law. This means, if the law goes to the Supreme Court, we would need the Justices to go back on their previous opinion.

## Data

- Data, like oil, is extracted from a raw source, and then refined into useful products, like our cars, or applications.
- The saying "Data is the new oil" is a reference to the fact that data is the new resource that companies are trying to extract value from.
- Originally whale oil was commonly used in lamps and as lubrication for machines, but prices were skyrocketing. A Pennsylvania "startup" oil drilling company was trying to look for oil elsewhere. However, after a long time, they had still not found anything. The day after they were told to close up and stop drilling, they struck oil. Oil created amazing industries that give us many convenient products, but at what cost? If data is the new oil, there can be unintended harms of mining for data just like there was for oil. We discover massive stores of this raw material. It has spawned massive new industries. The value of oil as a raw material is likened to data as a raw material. We create data by surfing the web, social media, and so much more.

### DIKW Pyramid

---

- The DIKW pyramid is a model that describes the hierarchy of knowledge.
- Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom.
- In a human it is usually split 40% data, 30% information, 20% knowledge, 10% understanding, and 0% wisdom.

![DIKW Pyramid](imgs/dikw-pyramid.png)

#### Data
- Data is the rawest form of information.
- Data are products of observation.

#### Information
- Information is the result of processing data.
- By running analysis on data, we can turn data into information.
- Information is contained in descriptions.

#### Knowledge
- Knowledge is the know-how of how to do something.
- It makes control of the system possible.
- Knowledge can be obtained in two ways, transmission from another person, or by learning from experience.

#### Wisdom
- Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge to a situation.
- Wisdom requires judgement and experience.

## Databases

---

- A database is a logically coherent collection of related data.
- Databases turn data into information.
- SQL is run on relational databases.

### Relational Model:
- The relational model of databases involves organizing data into multiple related tables.
- Data values are only stored a single time and then referenced from a different table, saving space on the database and preventing integrity errors.

### Relations Domains and Tuples (Tables, Columns, Rows)
- Data in databases are stored in tables.
- Tables in the SQL server have two part names, the database name and the table name. [schema].[table]
- A schema is a bucket used to collect similar tables under one name.
- Schemas can be used to manage security.
- Relations, domains and tuples are the core components of a relational database.
  - Relations are tables.
  - Domains are columns.
    - Storing single values in table columns helps to make the table more flexible (storing street name, house number, zip all in diff columns)
  - Tuples are rows.
    - Horizontal components of a table that are made of the value stored across every column
	-Each record acts as a single, connected, unit

### CRUD Tasks
- **C**reate: Inserting data into a database.
- **R**ead: Retrieving data from a database.
- **U**pdate: Modifying data in a database.
- **D**elete: Removing data from a database.

#### Some other operations include:
- Performing scheduled backups of the database.
- Maintain redundant copies of the database.
- Control and monitor user access and privileges.
- Create visual reports that incorporate graphs.
- Create data entry forms.

#### Normalization:
- Organizing data in a database by establishing relationships between tables in order to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.
- Optimized for data storage

#### Denormalization:
- Intentionally breaking the rules of normalization in order to optimize for data retrieval in a relational database.

### Keys in Databases
---
#### Surrogate Keys
- A unique identifier to represent the contents on a row in the logical design of a relational database; value is not derived from the content of the data itself.
  - Example: Identity, Sequence, UserID

#### Natural Keys
- A unique identifier for the row in the logical design of a relational database as described using data attributes that exist within the data set and also have meaning outside the context of the database.

#### Primary Keys
- A field or fields that physically maintain and identify uniqueness of a row in a table.

#### Foreign Key
- A key that points to a primary key and creates a relationship between two tables and maintains data integrity.

#### Relational Database Structure
- These are tables of entities
- There is more organization by connecting certain columns to a certain column in a different table.


The **War of the Roses** was fought between the Houses of Lancaster and York.

### Two types of Knowledge

- **Tacit  Knowledge**
	- I know how to ride a bike.
	- I cannot read how to ride a bike
	- You need practice to create tacit knowledge.
	- Tacit knowledge is the **know HOW** not the **know THAT**.
- **Explicit Knowledge**
	- I KNOW that the warring factions of Lanncaster and Yorks from the House of Plantagenet fought in the war of the Roses.
	- I can learn about the War by reading about it.
	- Explicit knowledge is the **know THAT** not the **know HOW**.
	- It is easier to encode into material form.
  

#### Data Science Workflow
1. Data is collected from different sources
2. Collected data is organziaed and stored in databases for future use.
3. A individual in the future analyzes the information and makes connections between events, names and etc.
4. They then interpret the analysis and explains in a book or lecture what it means.

#### Dangerous Databases

How can databases be dangerous?

- We need a **sociotechnical system** to view how it can be dangerous.

## Data Analytics
- The process of analyzing large sets of data in order to extract useful insights and knowledge from it.
- What is the purpose?

### NSA's Prism Program:
- SIGINT Activity Designator US-984XN aka PRISM.
- Began in 2007 as "the number one source of raw intelligence used for the NSA analytical reports."
- This project was top-secret until a whistleblower released information about PRISM to the world.

#### Two Kinds of Data Analytics

##### Descriptive Analytics
- Focuses on understanding what has happened in the past.
- Historical data about company performance or sports performance.
- It is just a description, and describes what has happened in statistical and numerical terms.

##### Predictive Analytics
- Focuses on forecasting future events based on historical data.
- More than describing it, but to use the descriptions of what has happened in the past to attempt to predict the future.
- Uses statistical models of past events to probabilistically predict future outcomes.

### Networks are made of nodes and edges and properties
- Networks are made of nodes and edges
	- Nodes in our friendship networks are the individuals
	- Edges in our friendship networks are the friendships and relationships themselves
	- Called cliques or components

### Small World Phenomenon
- The idea that all people are connected by a small number of connections. *6 degrees of separation*

For example:

Alice:
- 0 degrees of separation from herself.

Alice's friends:
- 1 degree of separation from Alice.

Friends of each of Alice's friends:
- 2 degrees of separation from Alice.


## Cybersecurity and Privacy
- The CIA triad is a set of three principles that are used to guide the development of cybersecurity policies.
  - They are the 3 pillars of Information security.
	- **Confidentiality**: Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.
    	- Access and disclosure: Who can see it, who can spread it?
	- **Integrity**: Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity.
		- Modification and destruction: Who can change it, who can delete it?
	- **Availability**: The ability to protect information from unauthorized denial of access.
- Hacking in the Book of Genesis.

### Cybersecurity vs. Privacy
- Cybersecurity is the protection of organizations from theft or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
- Privacy is the protection of personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure by organizations.

### Privacy as A Right?
- The US Constitution does not explicitly mention privacy as a right.
- However, the Supreme Court has ruled that privacy is a right.
- The Penumbra of the Bill of Rights: The Supreme Court has ruled that the Bill of Rights protects privacy.
- "Specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance."

### Although Not a Right, It is a Law
- FERPA: Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
  - "The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education."
- Confidentiality, from the CIA Triad. 


Non-repudiation:
- A system that provides non-repudiation assures that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender's identity. **So neither can later deny having processed the information.**
- The goal is to avoid situations like these:
  - "I didn't get the message."
  - "I didn't send you the message."

Risk = Consequences x Probability

- Risk can never be fully eliminated. Security protections are implemented to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.

- Example: Risk of getting wet (low consequence) in the rain (high likelihood)
  - If the security measure of an umbrella, was really cheap, you would just get the umbrella. However, if it was a million dollars, or you need to pay by the minute, you might just choose not to get the umbrella.

A Typical Social Engineering Attack:

1) Often relies on human weaknesses, limitations, bias, etc..
2) Can get really ugly in predictable and unpredictable ways.
3) Typically involves a combination of social, technical, and physical skills.

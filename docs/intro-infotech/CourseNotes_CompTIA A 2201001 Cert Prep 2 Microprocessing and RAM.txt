Note Time:         Note Text:                     

0:00:57            The CPU is a incredible calculator that does things really fast. 

0:02:04            The external data bus helps communicate with the CPU 

0:03:40            8-bits is a byte               

0:05:43            Registers in the CPU to remember some information for the operations (general purpose registers) 

0:05:53            A modern CPU can have more than 100 registers 

0:07:27            The clock's job is to tell the CPU to do something 

0:12:27            A pipeline is basically running multiple tasks simultaneously 

0:13:48            Pipeline is also called a core

0:02:53            A system crystal is what pushes the clock on the CPU 

0:04:38            Clock multiplying helps to account for the differences in clock speeds in the CPU and the motherboard. 

0:06:17            Codenames describe the microarchitecture 

0:08:12            Overclocking is a process to push the motherboard and CPU faster 

0:08:23            Overclocking makes the system unstable 

0:08:40            Overclocking turns the knob up to make motherboard faster 

0:08:58            Multiple cores - multiple of these pipelines on it 

0:10:01            hyperthreading is when one super smart thread can handle two incoming threads of code

-----------------------------------------------
Note Time:         Note Text:                     

0:00:57            CPU cache is a place in the CPU to store some information temporarily 

0:01:08            When you run a program, some parts of the program gets copied to the RAM 

0:01:20            Then, it's fed into the CPU to be processed 

0:01:40            CPU is way faster than the RAM and the RAM cant keep up 

0:02:14            Cache is basically a little tiny piece of ram called SRAM, which is much fastrer 

0:03:28            How companies design a cache is different and can affect the performance of the CPU 

0:03:42            when the piece of code a CPU needs isnt there when it needs it, it's called a pipeline stall 

0:03:59            Every CPU comes with 3 cache, majority 

0:04:25            1. L1 Cache (level 1 cache) - So fast that it runs at the multiplied speed of the CPU 

0:04:44            2. L2 Cache feeds the L1 cache, much bigger, but runs at half of the clock multiplier speed 

0:05:28            3. L3 Cache is big, megabyte size, and is base motherboard speed

0:01:36            RAM looks like a 1 column spreadsheet 

0:02:20            Memory controller Chips used to be a separate chip but nowadays is built into the CPU 

0:02:38            It can grab any byte of memory to be sent to the CPUI 

0:03:11            Address bus is a direct connection between the CPU and MCC to tell the MCC which byte of mem it needs rn 

0:05:05            32-bit / 64-bit actually describes the size of the address buses. 32 bit = 32 wires as each wire can emit a on/off signal of 0/1 

0:05:20            32-bit supports up to 4 gigs of ram 

0:05:45            64-bit CPUs are able to support much much more than 4 gigs of ram 

0:06:43            every 64-bit CPU can run 32-bit apps as well 

0:10:16            x86 means 32-bit

Note Time:         Note Text:                     

0:01:58            Microarchitecture is the circuit diagram inside the CPU 

0:02:47            Manufacturers of CPUs will create a Family name for a microarchitecture and create many different models based on that.

Example: Intel Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, all split between i5, i7, i9. AMD Zen 2, Zen 3, Zen 3+, Zen 4 architecture split between Ryzen 5, 7, 9 as well. 

0:05:58            SKU - sales inventory code     

0:08:05            Some CPU gens can change the socket types 

0:08:06            PGA - pin grid array           

0:08:24            LGA - land grid array, it has little pads and the sockets we drop it into has pins to make contact 

0:09:08            AM4 is what AMD calls their sockets 

0:09:29            LGA 1151 is the number of pins 

0:10:14            LGA 1151 is a mainstream type of socket for i5-i7 

0:10:25            LGA 2066 is for high end CPUs like i9s 

0:10:45            AMD uses the AM4 socket which is for like ryzen 5, ryzen 7 

0:10:57            AMD TR4 is for like the ryzen 9s

0:02:27            There are AM4 socket CPUs that are too fast for the motherboard 

0:03:00            Zero insertion force socket has a bar you can raise to drop the CPU in. 

0:04:18            Orientation notch is much more squared 

0:04:51            Close arm to lock it in        

0:05:02            thermal paste!!!!!!            

0:05:19            OEM CPUs all come with a fan, these fans are call OEM fans 

0:06:17            Thermal paste helps pull the heat from the CPU into the cooler 

0:08:56            Fans are super annoying to install 

0:09:03            Make sure everything is level  

0:09:50            4 pin connector on motherboard to give CPU power

0:00:31            Alternatives to OEM fans is liquid cooling 

0:00:46            Fans make noise, and if we can make it less noisy its good 

0:01:05            OEM fan made by cooler master made to take away more heat 

0:02:39            Two hoses, one to take away hot liquid and one to bring back the cooled air

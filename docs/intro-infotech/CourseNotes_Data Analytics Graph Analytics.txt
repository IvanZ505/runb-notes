0:00:05            Graph analytics can be used to analyze networks visually using nodes edges and properties. 

0:00:19            They can be applied to any dataset that can be described in those terms 

0:00:37            Train system maps are a good way to look at a system of graph analytics 

0:01:08            You can also use graph analytics to analyze the effects of certain nodes being shut down as well as how central a connection is.

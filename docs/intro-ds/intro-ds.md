## What is Data Science?

- Data is growing, but its not only massive data, but also massive models and massive computation. (e.g. LLMs)
- Data contains value and knowledge.

### Data Science and Data Mining
- To extract the knowledge data needs to be:
	- Stored (*Database systems*)
	- Managed (*Data Management for Data Science*)
	- And **Analyzed** <- this class (*Data Science and Data Mining*)

### What is Data Mining?
- Given a lot of data
- *Discover patterns and models that are:*
	- **Valid:** Hold on new data with some certainty
	- **Useful:** Should help us learn something from data.
	- **Unexpected:** Non-obvious to us
	- **Understandable:** Humans should be able to interpret the pattern.

> In this class, we not only work with this *Big Data*, but we make predictions and analysis from the data.

### Why Data "Science"
- Brahe collected a lot of data about planetary motion. (Time and position about how planets circle around the sun.)
- Then, Kepler, student of Brahe, analyzed Brahe's data and discovered the rules behind how planets orbit the sun.

Due to the massive amount of data out there, it is almost impossible to manually analyze the data. This is why we need algorithms.
#### The Flow of Data Science

> Data Collection (almost automatic) -> Data analytics (What?) -> Data interpretation

### Data Mining Tasks

#### Descriptive Methods
- Find human-interpretable patterns that describe the data.
	- **Example:** Clustering

#### Predictive Methods
- Use some variable to predict unknown or future values of other variables.
	- **Example:** Recommender systems, Computational Advertising, etc.

### This Class
- This class overlaps with machine learning, statistics, artificial intelligence, databases but more stress on:
	- **Scalability:** (big data and big models)
	- **Algorithms**
	- **Computing Architectures**
	- Automation for handling **large data**

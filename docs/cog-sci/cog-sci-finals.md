## Terms to Know

### Module 7
- **Design features**
- **Competence and performance**
- **Mental grammar**
- **Recursion**
- **Universal Grammar**
- **Critical Period**

### Module 8
- **Retina**
- **Rods and cones**

## Module 7: The Language Instinct

### Features of Language

- Mode: Can have more than one mode of expression (verbal speech, sign language, etc.)
- Meaning: Terms have specific semantic meaning
- **Arbitrariness**: You are unable to predict the meaning of a word based on how it sounds.
	- For example: The word *dog* does not give the mental image of a dog.
- Discreteness: languages are composed of atomic units
- Displacement: can talk about things not immediately present in scenario
- Productivity: Can create novel sentences
- Cultural transmission: Main way of acquiring a language is having it be transmitted to you. (You need to learn it from someone else)

### Structure of Language
- *Will be asked something on hierarchical structure*

- **Hierarchical Structure**: *Best way we have to represent human thought*
	- I have thought in my head, and I express my thought as **language**.
	- My thought has a hierarchical structure, but the language does not.
	- We care about the top-down structure of the language and what has the **highest relationship**

- **Tree Structure**
	- A sentence is made of **constituents** (group of words), so that the same sequence of words can have multiple meanings.

> **The Structure of human thought is *invariant***. (Everyone thinks in basically the same way, across languages)

### C-Command Relationship
- Up 1 level, then down
- When using the *self* pronoun, the sentence has to be in the correct *structural relationship* in order for the sentence to make sense.

### Recursion
- *Infinite use of finite means*
- You can keep on generating new sentences for **infinity**.

---
## Module 7: The Mind's Eye
- **Important**: *difference between sensation and perception*
	- Sensation: Sensation is the raw detection of the stimulus. There is no understanding here of what the stimulus is.
	- Perception: Having some kind of understanding about the stimulus is perception.

---
#### Blind Spot
- Humans have a blind spot because cables are backwards.
- The cables have to punch back through your retina in order to feed information, causing a blind-spot.
### Top-Down Processing
- Filling in information using preconceptions.
- *Color constancy*, *Amodal Completion*
### Bottom-Up Processing
- Information flowing from the senses to perception.
- Data driven, you have no idea what you are looking at and let your senses do the work.

---
### Feature Integration Theory
- The fewer features you are looking for, the faster you will be.
- As you add distractors, if you are searching for multiple features, the search time will increase.
- However, if you are only searching for limited features, the number of distractors does not affect search time.
- When looking for something, you engage in a 3-step process.

**Step 1**: Really fast
- Identify single salient feature
- Such as identifying a blue circle in a sea of red circles.
- Nothing pops out

**Step 2**: Focused Attention
- Slower, effortful, attentive
- More than one feature that is different, takes a lot longer and is harder.

**Step 3:** Object recognition

---

## Module 8: Memory

- **Important**: Might be asked to describe an algorithm for how you remember things that appear.
	- *Working memory*, *serial search*, *parallel search*
	- *Self-terminating search*, *exhaustive search* (we use exhaustive search)

#### Negative Trials
- Proved that we use exhaustive search.

---
## Module 9: The Origins of the Mind

- **Important**: What do babies know right away, and what do they need to learn.
- **Empiricism vs Nativism**

### Subitizing Number System
- **Babies have an innate sense of numbers**
- Although babies can not express in words the number system, however, they have an innate ability to sense quantities between 0-4.

---
## Module 10: The Rational Mind

### Heuristics

#### Anchoring

![](imgs/anchoring-bias.png)

- If you give someone an initial number, people tend to *anchor* onto that number and it influences them in their answers.

### Dunning-Kruger Effect
- Confidence is (*mildly*) inversely correlated with actual knowledge.

---
## Module 11: Emergence of The Mind

### Eusociality
- Humans are highly social (eusocial) animals.

> We live in complex, hierarchal societies...

**This means that we need...**
### Theory of Mind
- The ability to model other minds - to see the world from their perspective and understand their mental states.
- We all model the outside world via mental representations.
- We also model the internal mental states of other human beings.
	- *Ability to theorize what other minds want to do

---

- You are not born with theory of mind.
- You are very self-centered when you are a baby.

### Theory-Theory vs Simulation Theory

#### Simulation Theory

![](imgs/Simulation-theory-of-other-minds.png)

- Using yourself to simulate the knowledge of someone else.
- "What would they do?"

#### Theory-Theory
- Logical inferences
- Abstract theory of how people behave

# Ch3: Computational Minds

#### Meat Machines
- The fact that it is meat does not matter, what matters is the machine.

### Computational Theory of Mind
- The brain is merely a meat machine.
- The mental processes are computations.
- A machine computes an algorithm: roughly an explicit, step-by-step procedure for answering some questions or solving some problem.
- The algorithm maps structural states of a physical system as an input to other structural states.

#### Symbols
- Crucial for Turing computation
- The mind contains symbols ($)
- Symbols have two features at least:
	- Formal properties: How the symbol is shaped
	- Semantic properties: How the symbol represents the world.

- What is so powerful about Turing computation is that there can then be transitions between arrangements of symbols in virtue of their formal properties that nonetheless respect their semantic properties.


### Andy Clark
- The mind is not *like* a computer, it **is** a computer.

#### Definitions of Computer

**Functional**
- Someone/something that performs mathematical operations.

**Churchland + Seinowski (1992)**
- Something can only be identified as a computer if inputs + outputs can be usefully + systematically interpreted as representing ordered pairs of some function of interest.
	- Input/output mapping, interpret as how it describes as interesting function.
	
### Computations are a FORMAL system
- Extremely rule-based operations where the content does not matter as much as the rules. (Board games, **discrete mathematics(ugh)**) Even if all content is replaced, all arguments will still hold so long as rules apply.
	- This goes against *Identity theory* because this is saying that the physical makeup of something does not matter, only how it works.

### The Halting Problem
- Some programs, given some inputs, will complete and give a good output. Some programs, given some inputs, will get stuck in an infinite loop. --> **Turing Machine**

### Turing Machine

**It contains**:
- An infinite tape
- A read/write head
- An alphabet of Symbols
- A set of instructions (the machine table)

**His Impact**:
- The Turing Machine formalized algorithms and is the basis of all modern computing.
- Turing has been influential not just for computer science, but for cognitive science as a whole.

**Computability (Church-Turing Thesis)**:
- "No computational procedure will be considered as an algorithm unless it can be represented as a Turing Machine."
- "A function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process."

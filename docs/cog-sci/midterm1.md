## Multiple Realizability
- A single mental state can be realized by many different physical states.
- This means that the study of minds goes beyond just human minds.
- No mental kind is identical to any specific physical kind.

## Functionalism
- "What makes something a thought, desire, pain (or any other type of metal state) depends not on its internal constitution, but soleyl on its function, or the role it plays, in the cognitive system of which it is a part." - Janet Putnam

## Three Levels of Analysis
- **Computational Level**: What is the task that the system is performing and why?
- **Algorithmic Level**: How does the system perform this task?
  - These are the specific steps that the system takes to perform the task.
- **Implementation Level**: How is the system physically realized?
  - The implementation level is the only level that is concerned with the physical world.

## Representations
- Representations are the things that stand for other things.
- Representations of numbers could be the number of fingers you're holding up, our number system, or the tally marks on a piece of paper.
  - Each type of representation gives up something in order to gain something else.
  - Ex: Tally marks are easy to make, easy to add, but hard to sum up if you have a lot of them.

### Mental Representations
- Most mental representations have a *referent* in the real world that the representation stands in for.
  - e.g. Professor Ryan's cat
- The representation has content.
- The bearer of the representation is the thing that realizes the representation.
  - e.g. Professor Ryan's brain

**Examples of Mental Representations**
- Imagistic representations
  - e.g. (Insert picture of money here)
- Propositional representations
  - e.g. "money"
- Symbolic representations
  - e.g. "$"

#### Aphantasia in Mental Representation
- Aphantasia tells us that every person's mental representations are different.
- Although they can not visualize things, they are still good at tasks that may require visualization, meaning that they are using a different type of mental representation.

#### Digital vs. Analog Representations
- Digital representations are discrete and symbolic.
  - e.g. Binary
- Analog representations are continuous spectrum.
  - e.g. Color spectrum

## Mind and Body

**Need to Know**:
- Know the difference between Dualism and Monism
- **Platonic Dualism** - There is a ideal world and then our physical world. The ideal world is perfect and the us in the ideal world has access to all the knowledge in the world. When we think hard enough and in the right way, we are able to access this knowledge.
- Aristotelian Physicalism
- Cartesian Dualism
- Idealism
- Physicalism
- Identity Theory
- **Reductionism** - Reducing everything down to the simplest possible explanation.

## Behaviorism
- Only way to learn was behavior and punishment.

**Types of Behaviorism**
- Methodological behaviorism
  - They exist and are important.
- Radical behaviorism
  - They exist but are not important.
- Analytical behaviorism
  - They do not exist so they are not important.
  
## Tolman's Rats

**Finding Rat's Algorithm**

**Results**

**Why it matters** : At this time nobody could figure out how to observe an algorithm in the mind. This was a breakthrough as they just modelled out the algorithm that the rats were using.

## Simulation vs Instantiation**

- What makes a computer a computer is not what it is made of, but what it does.
  - Information processing is what it does.
  - A *simulated* computer, is STILL a computer, because what matters is its information processing profile.
- For non-informational systems, what matters is what it is made of.
  - e.g. A simulated car is not a car.
  - e.g. A simulated pizza is NOT a pizza. (I can't eat it)

## Turing Machines
- A Turing Machine is a theoretical machine that can compute anything that is computable.

**Components**
- It has a theoretically infinite tape.
- It has a read/write head that can read and write to the tape.
- It has an alphabet of symbols that it can read and write.
- It has a machine table that tells it what to do based on the symbol it reads and the state it is in.

### Computability
- A problem is computable if there is a Turing Machine that can solve it.
- This means that, if the Turing Machine is able to compute anything, then you can be computed.

## Chinese Room Argument
- The Chinese Room Argument is an argument against the idea that a computer can think.
- The argument is that a computer can not think because it is just a symbol manipulator.
  - There is no understanding of the symbols.

## What is Cognitive Science?

- Cognitive Science is the science of the mind.
- You need a set of cognitive laws in order to explain how it is that anything on this planet is capable of thinking.

#### ChatGPT Rules
- Create your own prompt
- Share the prompt with the Prof
- Evaluate the responses to the prompts

#### What is it REALLY?

Cognitive science is the *interdisciplinary* study of the mind (or minds) as an **information processor**.

- It's the study of the mind, not the brain. (It's different trust)
- We think of the mind as more of a ***computer***.
- We are here to **ask** questions.

#### The Intersections of 6 Fields:

**Philosophy**:
- Raises questions
- Defines Concepts
- Gives us directions

**Psychology**:
- Focus on mental processes.
- Learning, memory, attention

**Neuroscience**:
- Focuses on the *brain*
- Maps mental processes to physical structures

**Computer science**:
- Creating artificial minds
- Defines old problems in new ways

**Linguistics**:
- Models language as a cognitive system

**Anthropology**:
- Gives us a scope of human culture, behavior, thought

##### While original diagrams were all hexagons with these 6 fields, we can really also add:

- **Economics**
- **Engineering** (robotics, AI in robots)
- **Biology** (Biological system, animal cognition)
- **Education**
- **Genetics**
- **Sociology**

### The Different Stages of Cog Sci (But science in General)

1. Theorizing
2. Documenting
3. Experimenting
4. Engineering

### Minds

What *is* a mind?


Functionalism:

- "What makes something a thought, desire, pain (or anyy other type of mental state) depends not on its internal constitution, but solely on its function, or the role it plays, in the cognitive system of which it is a part."

### Multiple Realizability Thesis
- **Three acceptable ways to describe this**
	- It can be realized by, instantiated by, executed by, implemented by.
- All mental kinds are multiply realizable by distinct physical kinds.
	- There are many ways to reach a specific type of mental state.
- If a given mental kind is multiply realizable by distinct physical kinds, then it cannot be identical to any specific physical kind.
- No mental kind is identical to any specific physical kind.

- Think about it like a game being ported between console and PC. The underlying code might be "different", but the game is still the same at the very top despite being not the same.

(Technically you can also give a computer "pain". You don't really know if your computers really feel "pain")

### Brain State vs. Mental state

- We can think of the brain as the "hardware" and we can think of the mental state as the "software".

**Cognitive Science** is the study of the mind as "information processing".

We think about minds in the same way we think about the computer with I/O.

Everything you do has to be able to be described as "computations".

### The *Mozart* of Cog Sci:

"If one hopes to achieve a full understanding of a system as complicated as a nervous system, a developing embryo, a set of metabolic pathways, a boottle of gas, or even a large computer, then one must be prepared to contemplate different kinds of explanation at different levels of description that are linked, at least in principle, into a cohesive whole, eevn if linking the levels in complete detail is impractical." - David Marr, *Vision* (1982)

#### As Defined by David Marr, there are 3 Levels of Analysis:

**Computational Level** (top level/computational theory level):

(Anthropology, Philosophy, Linguistics, Computer Science)

- What is the goal of the system?
- What will have been done or accomplished after the system has run its course?
- What will the output of the computation look like?

Models:
- Relate input to Output
- Specify structure and relationships within the complex system.


**Algorithmic Level)** (The How level):

(Computer Science, Psychology)
- What steps are taken to accomplish that goal?
- What kinds of representations are created?
- What operations are performed?

**Implementational Level** (How is it physically implemented):

(Neuroscience)
- What is the physical system that executes the steps?
- How are the steps executed, physically?
- What brain regions are active during cognitive tasks?
- What are the physical processes?

### Levels of Analysis Case Study: Chess

- Computational Level
	- What is the goal?
	- In order to understand the goal "checkmating the king", you need to know the entire theory of chess in order to explain it.
- Algorithmic Level
	- How do you win?
	- You can not make specific steps. You need a way of pattern recognition. 
- Implementation Level
	- How is chess physically implemented?
	
### Case study: Cash Register

- Computational level
	- The purpose the cash register is to take the value of everything you want to buy and add it together for the cashier.
	
- Algorithmic Level
	- Commutativity and Associativity
	- Representation
	- Algorithm
	
	- "There is a trade-off, any particular representation makes certain information explicit at the expense of information that is pushed into the background and might be hard to recover." - David Marr
		- Examples of this: Tallies, Roman numerals

### What's in your mind?
- Actions : When you move, walk, run, driving.
- Perception: To do action, you really do need perception. To smell, to see, to hear
- Memory: You need to remember things like what you learn in this class.
- Language: We use language every day, it's a cognitive system.
- Decision:  You need to decide which classes to take, whether to come in this morning.
- Reason: How to rationale. 
- Creativity: Ability to create things and do novel things contained in your mind.
- Emotions

Everything in your mind can be described as **Computation representation**.

### Representation Systems
- There is an *indirect* relation between the signal and the system. It needs to be *anticipatory*
	- (There needs to be ***Storage*** for the representation system)
	- For example, a plant responding to the sun is not a representation system because it responds to the sun hitting its leaves, but doesn't store that information.
- something *stands in* for the signal
	- Using some sort of symbols to stand in for the signal.
	- If that plant encoded something in their molecules to remember when the sun comes out.
- the stand ins are part of a larger representation *scheme*
	- There are many other purposes for stand in.
	- For example, when you take a photo of someone, that is a representation system because the stand-in (the photo encoded onto your phone) can be used to recognize the person, to set as their profile, etc...
	
The human mind is a representational system that uses symbols and concepts to stand in for things in the world.

**Bearer**: The bearer realizes the representation.

- This is where the stand-in happens.
- Bearer sees cat. Can not fit cat in your head.
- The stand-in for cat gets encoded in your brain.

**Referent**: The thing in the external world that the representation stands for.

- The cat is the bearer.
	
**Content**: The content is the stand-in for the real world item.

**Intentionality**: The mental content has a relationship to the real world referent.

#### Types of Mental Representations
- Imagistic -----> Picture of money
- Propositional -----> "Money"
- Symbolic ------> $

**Propositional**:
- Sentence like structure.
- Truth value: can be *true* or *false*.
- Objects of "propositional attitudes".
- Specify some way the world *could* be.

**Symbolic**:
- A symbol  stands for an idea or object but does not have a genuine resemblance.

#### All mental Representations are:

**Digital**:
- Discrete
- Categorical
- e.g: numbers, specific hexcodes.

**Analog**:
- Continuous
- Spectrum
- e.g: stopwatch

- **Weber's Law**: The discriminability of any two magnitudes is a function of their ratio.

---

#### These Mental Representations:

Allow us to:
- Picture objects and situations.
- Reason about objects and abstract ideas.
- Plan and carry out appropriate actions.
- Communicate with others.
- Engage in forms of social cooperation.

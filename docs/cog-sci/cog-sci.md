## What is Cognitive Science?

- Cognitive Science is the science of the mind.
- You need a set of cognitive laws in order to explain how it is that anything on this planet is capable of thinking.
- Amended 9/29 : Cognitive Science looks into computational laws that govern our world, not physical or natural laws.

#### ChatGPT Rules
- Create your own prompt
- Share the prompt with the Prof
- Evaluate the responses to the prompts

#### What is it REALLY?

Cognitive science is the *interdisciplinary* study of the mind (or minds) as an **information processor**.

- It's the study of the mind, not the brain. (It's different trust)
- We think of the mind as more of a ***computer***.
- We are here to **ask** questions.

#### The Intersections of 6 Fields:

**Philosophy**:
- Raises questions
- Defines Concepts
- Gives us directions

**Psychology**:
- Focus on mental processes.
- Learning, memory, attention

**Neuroscience**:
- Focuses on the *brain*
- Maps mental processes to physical structures

**Computer science**:
- Creating artificial minds
- Defines old problems in new ways

**Linguistics**:
- Models language as a cognitive system

**Anthropology**:
- Gives us a scope of human culture, behavior, thought

##### While original diagrams were all hexagons with these 6 fields, we can really also add:

- **Economics**
- **Engineering** (robotics, AI in robots)
- **Biology** (Biological system, animal cognition)
- **Education**
- **Genetics**
- **Sociology**

### The Different Stages of Cog Sci (But science in General)

1. Theorizing
2. Documenting
3. Experimenting
4. Engineering

### Minds

What *is* a mind?


Functionalism:

- "What makes something a thought, desire, pain (or anyy other type of mental state) depends not on its internal constitution, but solely on its function, or the role it plays, in the cognitive system of which it is a part."

### Multiple Realizability Thesis
- **Three acceptable ways to describe this**
	- It can be realized by, instantiated by, executed by, implemented by.
- All mental kinds are multiply realizable by distinct physical kinds.
	- There are many ways to reach a specific type of mental state.
- If a given mental kind is multiply realizable by distinct physical kinds, then it cannot be identical to any specific physical kind.
- No mental kind is identical to any specific physical kind.

- Think about it like a game being ported between console and PC. The underlying code might be "different", but the game is still the same at the very top despite being not the same.

(Technically you can also give a computer "pain". You don't really know if your computers really feel "pain")

### Brain State vs. Mental state

- We can think of the brain as the "hardware" and we can think of the mental state as the "software".

---

**Cognitive Science** is the study of the mind as "information processing".

We think about minds in the same way we think about the computer with I/O.

Everything you do has to be able to be described as "computations".

### The *Mozart* of Cog Sci:

"If one hopes to achieve a full understanding of a system as complicated as a nervous system, a developing embryo, a set of metabolic pathways, a boottle of gas, or even a large computer, then one must be prepared to contemplate different kinds of explanation at different levels of description that are linked, at least in principle, into a cohesive whole, eevn if linking the levels in complete detail is impractical." - David Marr, *Vision* (1982)

#### As Defined by David Marr, there are 3 Levels of Analysis:

**Computational Level** (top level/computational theory level):

(Anthropology, Philosophy, Linguistics, Computer Science)

- What is the goal of the system?
- What will have been done or accomplished after the system has run its course?
- What will the output of the computation look like?

Models:
- Relate input to Output
- Specify structure and relationships within the complex system.


**Algorithmic Level)** (The How level):

(Computer Science, Psychology)
- What steps are taken to accomplish that goal?
- What kinds of representations are created?
- What operations are performed?

**Implementational Level** (How is it physically implemented):

(Neuroscience)
- What is the physical system that executes the steps?
- How are the steps executed, physically?
- What brain regions are active during cognitive tasks?
- What are the physical processes?

---

### Levels of Analysis Case Study: Chess

- Computational Level
	- What is the goal?
	- In order to understand the goal "checkmating the king", you need to know the entire theory of chess in order to explain it.
- Algorithmic Level
	- How do you win?
	- You can not make specific steps. You need a way of pattern recognition. 
- Implementation Level
	- How is chess physically implemented?
	
### Case study: Cash Register

- Computational level
	- The purpose the cash register is to take the value of everything you want to buy and add it together for the cashier.
	
- Algorithmic Level
	- Commutativity and Associativity
	- Representation
	- Algorithm
	
	- "There is a trade-off, any particular representation makes certain information explicit at the expense of information that is pushed into the background and might be hard to recover." - David Marr
		- Examples of this: Tallies, Roman numerals

---

### What's in your mind?
- Actions : When you move, walk, run, driving.
- Perception: To do action, you really do need perception. To smell, to see, to hear
- Memory: You need to remember things like what you learn in this class.
- Language: We use language every day, it's a cognitive system.
- Decision:  You need to decide which classes to take, whether to come in this morning.
- Reason: How to rationale. 
- Creativity: Ability to create things and do novel things contained in your mind.
- Emotions

---

Everything in your mind can be described as **Computation representation**.

### Representation Systems
- There is an *indirect* relation between the signal and the system. It needs to be *anticipatory*
	- (There needs to be ***Storage*** for the representation system)
	- For example, a plant responding to the sun is not a representation system because it responds to the sun hitting its leaves, but doesn't store that information.
- something *stands in* for the signal
	- Using some sort of symbols to stand in for the signal.
	- If that plant encoded something in their molecules to remember when the sun comes out.
- the stand ins are part of a larger representation *scheme*
	- There are many other purposes for stand in.
	- For example, when you take a photo of someone, that is a representation system because the stand-in (the photo encoded onto your phone) can be used to recognize the person, to set as their profile, etc...
	
The human mind is a representational system that uses symbols and concepts to stand in for things in the world.

**Bearer**: The bearer realizes the representation.

- This is where the stand-in happens.
- Bearer sees cat. Can not fit cat in your head.
- The stand-in for cat gets encoded in your brain.

**Referent**: The thing in the external world that the representation stands for.

- The cat is the bearer.
	
**Content**: The content is the stand-in for the real world item.

**Intentionality**: The mental content has a relationship to the real world referent.

---

#### Types of Mental Representations
- Imagistic -----> Picture of money
- Propositional -----> "Money"
- Symbolic ------> $

**Propositional**:
- Sentence like structure.
- Truth value: can be *true* or *false*.
- Objects of "propositional attitudes".
- Specify some way the world *could* be.

**Symbolic**:
- A symbol  stands for an idea or object but does not have a genuine resemblance.

#### All mental Representations are:

**Digital**:
- Discrete
- Categorical
- e.g: numbers, specific hexcodes.

**Analog**:
- Continuous
- Spectrum
- e.g: stopwatch

- **Weber's Law**: The discriminability of any two magnitudes is a function of their ratio.

---

#### These Mental Representations:

Allow us to:
- Picture objects and situations.
- Reason about objects and abstract ideas.
- Plan and carry out appropriate actions.
- Communicate with others.
- Engage in forms of social cooperation.

### How Do you Experience Representation?

**Cartesian Theater** :

- This is the philosophical idea that there is a "inner theater" that plays in the mind, which is watched by a "little man" or *homunculus*. However, then there's another little man in the little man's head, and so on...

- This Cartesian Theater has a **grounding problem**.

#### The Evolution of the two Beliefs

![Daulism to Monism](imgs/roadmap-beliefs.png)

## Dualism

### Platonic Dualism:

- Theory of Forms
- We are chained to the physical world where nothing is perfect.
- We have access to all knowledge in the world, and if we just *think* hard enough and in the right way, we can access the ideal world and learn anything.

![Platonic Dualism](imgs/platonic-dualism.png)

### Substance Dualism (Rene Descartes):

- Minds and bodies are made of different substances (Like literally.)
- He believed the mind was superior to the body.
- Influenced by Christianity.

**Res Extensa**: This is the physical stuff, the tangible stuff.

**Res Cognitans**: This is still a substance, like the thinky stuff, just a substance you can not see or touch.

Descartes came to this Substance Dualism through the:

---

#### Conceivability Argument:

- I can conceive hat I, a thinking thing, exist without my extended body existing.
- Anything I can conceive of is logically possible.
- If it is logically possible for X to exist without Y, then Y is not identical to Y. (If Superman (X) and Clark Kent (Y) are identical, if I kill superman (X) then Y better not show up)
- I, a thinking thing, am not identical with my extended body.

---

### Problems with Dualism

**Dualism says what the mind is *not:***
- The mind is *not* the brain.
- The mind is *not* the body.
- The mind is somehow *different* and *separate* from the physical world.

**However**, if they are different and separate, how do they interact with each other?

---

### Property Dualism:

**Biological Naturalism:**
- Mental state is what the brain does.
- Mental states are not identical to brain states, but they are causally reducible to brain states.

**Epiphenomenalism:**
- Mental states are caused by brain states, but they do not cause anything. They are causal dead ends.
- The mental states do not make you do anything, but whatever brain state causing your mental state makes you do things.

*Related: Illusionism*

**Panpsychism:**
- Mental states are an inherent property of matter or the organization of matter.
- There is like a atomic consciousness particle that everything is built out of and you can only get human consciousness with specific combination of these atomic consciousness particles.

---

## Monism

### Idealism:

- Everything in the universe is mentall or mentally-constructed.

	*Reality is an illusion*
	
	*Maybe the universe itself is a pervasive consciousness that connects all minds and souls together*

(This is the first stop of Monism because it describes the world as all just a illusion of your senses. It's all just mental states, and nothing is *real*)

### Physicalism

- Everything in the universe is *physical*

*Democritus'* Atom Theory:
- Everything in the unvierse is composed of *atoms*.
- The property of matter is the property of the atomic units they are made of.

*Modern* Identity Theory:
- Mental states are brain states.
- Being happy means you're in the happy brain states. (That's it)
- This is not compatible with Multiple Realizability (cus you can't have multiple Physical states corresponding to the same mental state when something like "happy" is tied to your brain state and we do not have the same brain as a dog)

*Aristotle*: "The distinction between mind and body is a distinction between **form** and **matter**.

---

### Reductionism

"I do not deny that conscious mental states and events cause behavior, nor that they may be given functional characterizations. I deny only that this kind of thing exhausts their analysis." - **Thomas Nagel**

- Any reductionist program has to be based on an analysis of what is to be reduced.
- If the analysis leaves something out, the problem will be falsely posed- It is useless to base the defense of materialism on any analysis of mental phenomena that fails to deal explicitly with their subjective character.

**Thomas Nagel's** argument:

- You can imagine being a bat and doing bat things, but you are just imagining *you* being a bat, and not a *bat* being a bat.
- You have no idea what they feel, what they think and what they face daily.
- Why do you not know? There's something that's missing...

**Qualia**: An unfamiliar term for someting that could not be more familiar to each of us - the way things seem to us. (Or how it **feels** to be you)

	Quantifying Thought:
	Qualia and the Mind-Body problem leaves us in a pickle.
	How can we bridgeg the subjective-object divide and quantify thought?
	How can we get at cognition?
	
#### The human mind is a black box.
- We can put in a stimuli, and see the response, but we do not know what is going on inside the black box.

---

"A purely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms are not an essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of conscious." - John B. Watson

- We need to focus on what we observe.
- Introspection is not going to get us to an answer.
- Interested in what can be measured.

---

### Behaviorism
- The view that a mental state is a disposition to some behavior.

**Methodological Behaviorism**
- Science should focus on observable, measurable entities and behaviors.
	- Watson, Hull, Tolman
	
**Radical Behaviorism**
- Internal mental states exist but they are unimportant and not very explanatory.
	- B.F. Skinner

- "Maybe those internal states exist but who cares?"
	
**Analytical Behaviorism**
- Mental concepts refer to behavioral tendencies.
	- Ryle
	
- Mind states do not actually exist. Those are BS. The feeling of "happy" is really just referring to all the behaviors that are associated with happy.

---

### Functionalism

(Mental states defined by functional profiles (computational levels))

**It goes against Behaviorism**
- Mental states are internal states.

**It goes against Identity Theory**
- Mental states multiply realizable and that mental states are not identical to single unique physical states.

- Behaviors can occur without conditioning, neural mapping doesn't explain mental states because it's not known how it relates (unknown relationship between neural circuits + experience).
- Much more useful to explain things in terms of mental states. (ex: dialed 911 because you wanted to get help is a non-conditional behavior. You were not trained to do that through conditioning. Specific neural circuits are also unhelpful to study.)


### Timeline of the Cognitive Revolution

**1930** - E.C. Tolman and Honzik
- Introduction and removal of reward, and maze performance in rats.
- Wanted to figure out how animals learned.
- Beginning of the end for behaviorism.

**1948** - Claude Shannon
- Information Theory : A way of quantifying communication of information.

**1950** - Alan Turing
- *Computing Machinery and Intelligence*
- Turing test

**1956** - George Miller
- *The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two*
- The magical number seven refers to how much you can keep in your short term memory.
- George Miller quantified memory (literally) into what **number**.

**1957** - Noam Chomsky
- *Syntactic structures*, creates modern generative linguistics.
- He did some interesting work and came up with a metric for measuring the complexity of different computations.

#### E.C. Tolman's Rats

- Rats put into the maze
- They are divided into 3 different categories.

![Tolman Rats Layout](imgs/tolman-layout.png)

![Tolman Rats Result](imgs/tolman-result.png)

- The rats that never got rewards do no better than chance.
- The rats that always got a reward get better with time, ending at around 20% of an error rate.
- The rats that only got a reward after a delay, immediately got way better.
	- They were learning that entire time.
	
**This experiment proved that you can still learn things when you are not being rewarded.** 

#### How are the rats navigating the maze?

(What is the algorithm for the rats to solve the maze.)

- *Response Learning* - Learning by remembering a sequence of movements.
- *Place Learning* - Learning by remembering the spatial layout of the maze.

![Rats Part 2](imgs/tolman-rats-pt2.png)

![Rats pt 2](imgs/toman-rats-pt2-results.png)

- Rats are not able to remember to always turn right.
- If you move the food, they do not know where the food is.


#### Meat Machines
- The fact that it is meat does not matter, what matters is the machine.

### Computational Theory of Mind:
- The brain is merely a meat machine.
- The mental processes are computations.
- A machine computes an algorithm: roughly an explicit, step-by-step procedure for answering some questions or solving some problem.
- The algorithm maps structural states of a physical system as an input to other structural states.

#### Symbols
- Crucial for Turing computation
- The mind contains symbols ($$$)
- Symbols have two features at least:
	- Formal properties: How the symbol is shaped
	- Semantic properties: How the symbol represents the world.

- What is so powerful about Turing computation is that there can then be transitions between arrangements of symbols in virtue of their formal properties that nonetheless respect their semantic properties.


### Andy Clark
- The mind is not *like* a computer, it **is** a computer.

#### Definitions of Computer

**Functional**
- Someone/something that performs mathematical operations.

**Churchland + Seinowski (1992)**
- Something can only be identified as a computer if inputs + outputs can be usefully + systematically interpreted as representing ordered pairs of some function of interest.
	- Input/output mapping, interpret as how it describes as interesting function.
	
### Computations are a FORMAL system
- Extremely rule-based operations where the content does not matter as much as the rules. (Board games, **discrete mathematics(ugh)**) Even if all content is replaced, all arguments will still hold so long as rules apply.
	- This goes against *Identity theory* because this is saying that the physical makeup of something does not matter, only how it works.

### The Halting Problem
- Some programs, given some inputs, will complete and give a good output. Some programs, given some inputs, will get stuck in an infinite loop. --> **Turing Machine**

---

### Turing Machine

**It contains**:
- An infinite tape
- A read/write head
- An alphabet of Symbols
- A set of instructions (the machine table)

![Machine Table](imgs/machine-table.png)

**His Impact**:
- The Turing Machine formalized algorithms and is the basis of all modern computing.
- Turing has been influential not just for computer science, but for cognitive science as a whole.

**Computability (Church-Turing Thesis)**:
- "No computational procedure will be considered as an algorithm unless it can be represented as a Turing Machine."
- "A function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process."

#### Artificial Intelligence
- A Turing machine is a symbolic processor that can compute anything.
- Does this mean everything a human mind can do, a Turing machine can do?
- Can computers have minds?

## What is Cognitive Science?

- Cognitive Science is the science of the mind.
- You need a set of cognitive laws in order to explain how it is that anything on this planet is capable of thinking.

#### ChatGPT Rules
- Create your own prompt
- Share the prompt with the Prof
- Evaluate the responses to the prompts

#### What is it REALLY?

Cognitive science is the *interdisciplinary* study of the mind (or minds) as an **information processor**.

- It's the study of the mind, not the brain. (It's different trust)
- We think of the mind as more of a ***computer***.
- We are here to **ask** questions.

#### The Intersections of 6 Fields:

**Philosophy**:
- Raises questions
- Defines Concepts
- Gives us directions

**Psychology**:
- Focus on mental processes.
- Learning, memory, attention

**Neuroscience**:
- Focuses on the *brain*
- Maps mental processes to physical structures

**Computer science**:
- Creating artificial minds
- Defines old problems in new ways

**Linguistics**:
- Models language as a cognitive system

**Anthropology**:
- Gives us a scope of human culture, behavior, thought

##### While original diagrams were all hexagons with these 6 fields, we can really also add:

- **Economics**
- **Engineering** (robotics, AI in robots)
- **Biology** (Biological system, animal cognition)
- **Education**
- **Genetics**
- **Sociology**

### The Different Stages of Cog Sci (But science in General)

1. Theorizing
2. Documenting
3. Experimenting
4. Engineering

### Minds

What *is* a mind?


Functionalism:

- "What makes something a thought, desire, pain (or anyy other type of mental state) depends not on its internal constitution, but solely on its function, or the role it plays, in the cognitive system of which it is a part."

### Multiple Realizability Thesis
- **Three acceptable ways to describe this**
	- It can be realized by, instantiated by, executed by, implemented by.
- All mental kinds are multiply realizable by distinct physical kinds.
	- There are many ways to reach a specific type of mental state.
- If a given mental kind is multiply realizable by distinct physical kinds, then it cannot be identical to any specific physical kind.
- No mental kind is identical to any specific physical kind.

- Think about it like a game being ported between console and PC. The underlying code might be "different", but the game is still the same at the very top despite being not the same.

(Technically you can also give a computer "pain". You don't really know if your computers really feel "pain")

### Brain State vs. Mental state

- We can think of the brain as the "hardware" and we can think of the mental state as the "software".

**Cognitive Science** is the study of the mind as "information processing".

We think about minds in the same way we think about the computer with I/O.

Everything you do has to be able to be described as "computations".

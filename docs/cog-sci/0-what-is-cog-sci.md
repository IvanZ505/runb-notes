- You need a set of cognitive laws in order to explain how it is that anything on this planet is capable of thinking.
- Amended 9/29 : Cognitive Science looks into computational laws that govern our world, not physical or natural laws.

**What is it REALLY?**

Cognitive science is the *interdisciplinary* study of the mind (or minds) as an **information processor**.

- It's the study of the mind, not the brain. (It's different trust)
- We think of the mind as more of a ***computer***.
- We are here to **ask** questions.

**It is The Intersections of 6 Fields:**

**Philosophy**:
- Raises questions
- Defines Concepts
- Gives us directions

**Psychology**:
- Focus on mental processes.
- Learning, memory, attention

**Neuroscience**:
- Focuses on the *brain*
- Maps mental processes to physical structures

**Computer science**:
- Creating artificial minds
- Defines old problems in new ways

**Linguistics**:
- Models language as a cognitive system

**Anthropology**:
- Gives us a scope of human culture, behavior, thought

**While original diagrams were all hexagons with these 6 fields, we can really also add:**

- **Economics**
- **Engineering** (robotics, AI in robots)
- **Biology** (Biological system, animal cognition)
- **Education**
- **Genetics**
- **Sociology**

**The Different Stages of Cog Sci**

1. Theorizing
2. Documenting
3. Experimenting
4. Engineering

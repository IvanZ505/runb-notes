### Why language?

"Cognitive science *is* linguistics, plus a little vision." - Jerry Fodor

- Language is important to how the mind works.

### What is language?

There are 7 essential features to language:

> 1. Mode = Can have more than one mode of expression (verbal speech, sign language, etc.)
> 2. Meaning = Terms have specific semantic meaning
> 3. Arbitrariness = Terms are arbitrary + have an arbitrary relationship with meaning
> 4. Discreteness = languages are composed of atomic units
> 5. Displacement = can talk about things not immediately present in scenario
> 6. Productivity = Can create novel sentences
> 7. Cultural transmission = Main way of acquiring a language is having it be transmitted to you. (You need to learn it from someone else)

**Case Study: Bees!**
- **Mode:** they dance in order to communicate
- **Meaning:** 
- **Arbitrariness:** 
- **Displacement:**

### Competence and Performance
- **Competence**
  	> **Knowing what to say**\
	> Subconscious knowledge of language

- **Performance**
	> **Being able to say it**\
	> Coordinating your linguistic knowledge with your other cognitive systems.

### Core of Language

- **Sounds:** (Phonology)
  - Inventory sequences
- **Words:** (Morphology)
  - Word forms, word parts, word building
- **Sentences:** (Syntax)
  - Word order, sentence structure
- **Meaning:** (Semantics)
  - Word meaning, sentence meaning

#### What do we do with Language?
- Communicate
- Think to ourselves
- Preserve information
- Refer to things in the world
- Assert beliefs and propositions that have truth values
- Be creative

#### Socially-Determined Conventions
- Languages, like English are social entities, created collectively by groups of individuals to facilitate communication betwene themselves and their fellows.
- Thus, what words belong to the language (what they mean and how they sound) and what rules govern how those words can be combined (their grammatical and syntactic rules) are matters of social convention.
- Langauge, in this picture, are like other rule-governed social structures: chess, legal system, codes of etiquette.
- Things can shift over time, and are prone to change.

### Chomsky
- For Chomsky (1965), language is a psychological entity- it exists in the mind of the speaker and nowhere else.

### Language Is Hierarchical

### Recursion in Language
- There is infinite use of finite means.
- There are some rules of language where the input for one rule may generate an output where the output can be the input for another rule.

### Verbal Behavior

**The Behaviorist View**:
- A child learns language through punishment and reward. 
- The child is rewarded when they say the right things (fed food) and when they don't say the right thing, they are punished (not fed food what they want).
- **The Issue**
  - Children are still fed even when they don't say the right thing.
  - Children do not actually correct their grammar when they are corrected.

### Poverty of the Stimulus
- The stimulus the learner is exposed to is not rich enough to account for the knowledge the learner acquires.

### Eric Lenneberg

Biologically Controlled Behaviors
- The behavior emerges before it is necessary.
- Its appearance is not the result of conscious decision.
- Its emergence is not directly triggered by external events.
- Direct teaching and intensive practice have relatively little effect on its emergence.
- There is a regular sequence of "milestones" as the behavior develops.
- There is likely a **critical period** for the acquisition of the behavior.

### What happens when the Critical Period is Missed?

#### The Tragedy of Genie Wiley
- Genie was severely abused and missed out on the critical period for language.

### Home Sign

### Nicaraguan Sign Language
- If kids are not exposed to language, they will create their own.
- The first generation of kids created a language that was very simple.
- The second generation of kids created a language that was more complex and containing all the features of a language.

1980 - First school for the deaf in Nicaragua

	First Gen: home sign
	Second Gen: Full blown language

# Undergraduate Seminar in Cognitive Science

## Most Meanings and Minds

> Taught by Paul M. Pietroski

- Many different ways to think of computations to get to the same answer.
- Distinct computational procedures can be provably equivalent.
	- It's easy to imagine a mind being able to do $|x-1|$ but not be able to do $^{nonneg}\sqrt{x^2-2x+1}$, even if they both return the same answer.
- Functions in Extension: Words have meaning to extract away from the set of things that are of a particular indentity so that everyone can agree on a group.
- Different ways to phrase questions:
	- Are most of the dots yellow? - English way
	- There are then mathematical ways.
- Hume's Principle - Given a notion of 1-1 correspondence and leftovers relations.
- Psycho-physical phenomenon (the numbers of the circles)
	- You count the numbers of things not the pixels and colors.
- Steal stuff from other fields of cog sci. Vision scientists work.
- You are way better at the task if you use "each", it prompts you to pay attention to individual items whereas "every" makes you see things in a group.
- Lost 5 dollars to a bet, logicians and philosophers bet on diff one.
- 7-8 is the limit before you're basically at chance to get it correct.
- ANS system is good with taking an estimate with the total number of dots.
	- Adding colors makes it even harder. W 5 colors it is impossible to estimate.
- Pitting most against 1-1 and then dir. comp. thought we were seeing no, its not negation but subtraction. The subsequent studies all point toward that. Borrowing from methods from elsewhere.

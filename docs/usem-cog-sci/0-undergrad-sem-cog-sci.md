# Undergraduate Seminar in Cognitive Science

## Most Meanings and Minds

> Taught by Paul M. Pietroski

- Many different ways to think of computations to get to the same answer.
- Distinct computational procedures can be provably equivalent.
	- It's easy to imagine a mind being able to do $|x-1|$ but not be able to do $^{nonneg}\sqrt{x^2-2x+1}$, even if they both return the same answer.
- Functions in Extension: Words have meaning to extract away from the set of things that are of a particular indentity so that everyone can agree on a group.
- Different ways to phrase questions:
	- Are most of the dots yellow? - English way
	- There are then mathematical ways.
- Hume's Principle - Given a notion of 1-1 correspondence and leftovers relations.
- Psycho-physical phenomenon (the numbers of the circles)
	- You count the numbers of things not the pixels and colors.
- Steal stuff from other fields of cog sci. Vision scientists work.
- You are way better at the task if you use "each", it prompts you to pay attention to individual items whereas "every" makes you see things in a group.
- Lost 5 dollars to a bet, logicians and philosophers bet on diff one.
- 7-8 is the limit before you're basically at chance to get it correct.
- ANS system is good with taking an estimate with the total number of dots.
	- Adding colors makes it even harder. W 5 colors it is impossible to estimate.
- Pitting most against 1-1 and then dir. comp. thought we were seeing no, its not negation but subtraction. The subsequent studies all point toward that. Borrowing from methods from elsewhere.


## Lecture 2/21

- 80/20 rule. 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort.
	- Even tho if feels like wasting time, you still are learning something.
	- Structured procrastination. 
- Econ profs make the most money.
- went to house party inviting psych. didn't know hosts were married.
- follow the rabbit holes and not over-optimizing.
- randomly tested guinea pigs and found out that vitamin c deficiency causes scurvy.
- academic writing isnt written to engage you, you are kind of forced to read it.
	- Read and recreate what others did.
- Unreplicable studies, big issue.
	- we are the curators, since we are giving the conclusion, which is what they take away.
- "why is there poverty" british politician story about interview
- when you take something thats common sense and invert it, you glean a lot...
- common frame of reference in that we are pretty wealthy, so we think that poverty is the enemy bc thats all we know.
- we take it for granted
- thomas jefferson complained that the ink freezes in the winter, even though he is the richest person in na at the time.
- poverty is not puzzling, WEALTH is puzzling, which is what needs to be explained.
- why do so many people follow laws? we take it for granted that we cooperate with one another.
- its not puzzling people belief false things, but that people believe true things.
- found neptune via math bc they found that there should be another thing there.
- theres no such thing as ether through which gravity propagates
- gravity warps space and time
- what are the questions children ask about the mind
-

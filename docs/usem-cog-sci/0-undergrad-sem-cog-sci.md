# Undergraduate Seminar in Cognitive Science

## Most Meanings and Minds

> Taught by Paul M. Pietroski

- Many different ways to think of computations to get to the same answer.
- Distinct computational procedures can be provably equivalent.
	- It's easy to imagine a mind being able to do $|x-1|$ but not be able to do $^{nonneg}\sqrt{x^2-2x+1}$, even if they both return the same answer.
- Functions in Extension: Words have meaning to extract away from the set of things that are of a particular indentity so that everyone can agree on a group.
- Different ways to phrase questions:
	- Are most of the dots yellow? - English way
	- There are then mathematical ways.
- Hume's Principle - Given a notion of 1-1 correspondence and leftovers relations.
- Psycho-physical phenomenon (the numbers of the circles)
	- You count the numbers of things not the pixels and colors.
- Steal stuff from other fields of cog sci. Vision scientists work.
- You are way better at the task if you use "each", it prompts you to pay attention to individual items whereas "every" makes you see things in a group.
- Lost 5 dollars to a bet, logicians and philosophers bet on diff one.
- 7-8 is the limit before you're basically at chance to get it correct.
- ANS system is good with taking an estimate with the total number of dots.
	- Adding colors makes it even harder. W 5 colors it is impossible to estimate.
- Pitting most against 1-1 and then dir. comp. thought we were seeing no, its not negation but subtraction. The subsequent studies all point toward that. Borrowing from methods from elsewhere.


## Lecture 2/21

- 80/20 rule. 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort.
	- Even tho if feels like wasting time, you still are learning something.
	- Structured procrastination. 
- Econ profs make the most money.
- went to house party inviting psych. didn't know hosts were married.
- follow the rabbit holes and not over-optimizing.
- randomly tested guinea pigs and found out that vitamin c deficiency causes scurvy.
- academic writing isnt written to engage you, you are kind of forced to read it.
	- Read and recreate what others did.
- Unreplicable studies, big issue.
	- we are the curators, since we are giving the conclusion, which is what they take away.
- "why is there poverty" british politician story about interview
- when you take something thats common sense and invert it, you glean a lot...
- common frame of reference in that we are pretty wealthy, so we think that poverty is the enemy bc thats all we know.
- we take it for granted
- thomas jefferson complained that the ink freezes in the winter, even though he is the richest person in na at the time.
- poverty is not puzzling, WEALTH is puzzling, which is what needs to be explained.
- why do so many people follow laws? we take it for granted that we cooperate with one another.
- its not puzzling people belief false things, but that people believe true things.
- found neptune via math bc they found that there should be another thing there.
- theres no such thing as ether through which gravity propagates
- gravity warps space and time
- what are the questions children ask about the mind

## Matthew Stone

- Rutgers purchased some subscriptions to LLMs such as copilot/
- LLMs are useful for thinking since we know they work differently.
- Bunch of bullet points
- meta trained its llm by using bittorrent feed of illegal copyrighted material, pirated books etc.
	- Common crawl - measures the size of the indices
- predict the next word, sound shapes of the word has temp. ambiguity. 
	- to resolve the ambiguity comp. sys use the prediction algo
- write email on what youve done bullet points.
- google build model in multilingual setting. english, spanish, german.
- as data decrease. fluency and effect of responses degrade.
- poverty of the stimulus
- he thinks connectionism is not the correct way to model. langauge models are a proof of concept that error signals...
- ml likes sys that learn from scratch. learning is not be all and end all of bio. cognition.
- get the data, predicting next word, reinforcement it.
- ask for the info that you want from them in a specific way
- profile of diff. neural behavior to show some pattern of bheaviour that diff neurons are exhibiting
	- successful in the early stages: sa visual info comes in
- dogs that run also bark? need to be sensitive to the unfolding syntactic relation.
- theres no way to know if ... reflects... the possibility of silicon minds.
- as long as neural networks are only appx. hooked up and cant do the causal and counterfactual reasoning... etc etc...?

## Kristen Syrett

- Inherent noise is noise in the data. Humans have to do that mapping process for words but there is a lot of noise.
- Gavagai problem? In a noisy scenario, it is difficult to map the sound and the meaning. for kids, they dont have any 1-1 mapping thingy.
- 11-13 months for first words
	- Before then, it's just babbling.
- well before they produce language, they are able to understand language. (5 months)
- expressive vocab: 75-500 words, receptive vocab: 300-900 words
- They give it meaning and category.
- In the beginning there is a lot of nouns, content words before function words.
	- function words are like and, or, the etc...
- locke says if we observe how children learn lang. people ordinarily show them the item and repeat the name that stands for it. "white", "sweet", "sugar", etc...
	- Building up association to teach babies.
	- Gavagai problem.
- Children learn specific nouns mapping onto discete objects easier.
- Children do not learn through imitation.
- The parents are producing language that is flawed and full of disfluencies. They produce a lot of junk, stopping, starting, and making mistakes.
- They are learning a rule like i "drived" there.
- whole object bias, taxonomic bias: new word, they have an assumption on what that meaning might be. shape bias: shape is a highly relevant sm for categorization
- mutual exclusivity, novel name nameless category, principle of contrast
- color is not a reliable feature for kids
- syntactic boostrapping - surface level structural properties of sentences are well correlated w certain aspects of their semantics
- numbers and adjectives each occupy their own position.
- in some languages they got no adjectives. no clear distinction beteween adjectives and verbs

## Karen Stromberg

- children must develop adult like competence
	- understanding the lang.
	- speaking the lang
	- normal intuitions about the language (metalinguistic knowledge)
- Chomsky
	- Acuisition is due to biological endowment
	- the innate biological mechinaisms are specific to language
	- They guess and induce the right rules

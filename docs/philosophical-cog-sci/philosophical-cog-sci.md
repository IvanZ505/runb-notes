## Course Content
- Investigation into foundational questions in cognitive science.
	- What is cognitive science?
	- What does it study? (Thinking? What is that??)
	- What is the basic structure of the mind?
	- What are non-human minds like?
- This topic is **hard** - so some of the readings will be hard! *Just do your best~~*

### What is this course?

- Our guide: Jerry Fodor (1935-2017), philosophy and founding member of RuCCS.
	- Fodor advanced a number of extremely controversial hypotheses about the mind, including:
		- We think in a private "Language of Thought" (*LoT*)
			- The way that we think is *computational*.
			- A huge point of contention in cognitive science. Should we think of the mind as a computer? If so, what type of computer?
		- Our minds include a number of isolatable "modules."
		- The mind does not work like a neural network.

## Units

### Unit 1: What is cognitive science?
- Behaviorism vs cognitive science
- Problems for reductionist neuroscience
- The Language of Thought (LoT)
	- LoT vs spoken language
		- Conditions where people lose the ability to speak language (Aphasia)
	- LoT vs neural networks
	- LoT in the brain?

### Unit 2: Modularity and Perception vs Cognition
- Is the mind a big soup of associations? Or is it organized into separate subsystems?
	- Fodor thought it was not a soup of associations.
- Does the way we think affect the way we see?
	- Biases and stuff? Does it affect how we visually see things?
	- Or is it that the visual system tells you the same things anyway and its the interpretation that is different.
- How smart are our visual systems?
	- Ex: You see friend in the distance but aren't sure until they are closer. Now is it the visual system that identifies the friend, or is it the cognitive system.
	- Does you visual system tell you something is a table or does it just give you the shapes and colors and then your cognitive system identifies it as the table?

### Unit 3: Non-standard minds: Animals, kids, AI
- Can apes think logically?
- ... Can toddlers?
- What does it mean to say an AI "thinks"?
- How do current AI models work? And how human-like are they, really?

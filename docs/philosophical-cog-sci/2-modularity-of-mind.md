# Modularity of Mind
- Hugely influential to this day
- Tackles *one of the core questions* of Cog Sci: What is the structure of the mind???
- How does the mind actually **break down** into different components?
- Historical antecedent: *faculty psychology*

### Faculty Psychology
- How is it that humans judge things to be true or false??
- We have a "*faculty of judgment*."
- Often understood in terms of *power*.
- It has been judged to be trivial, and doesn't actually say much...
	- "Opium makes us sleep b.c it has a "soporific power"
	- Then, maybe its not true that the mind breaks down into parts...
- **Also unattractive**-- some difference between (e.g.) short-term + long-term memory.
	- (someone's Wi-Fi password vs. your own.)
- Ways of differentiating parts of the mind without faculties?
	- Fodor doesn't consider this idea...

#### Fodor
- We need a faculty psychology that is compatible with the idea that **cognition = computation**.
- For him, a *Classical architecture*.

### Mental Organs
- **Chomsky:** "Language faculty"
- When studying language, we're not really studying the language, but we're studying a particular *part of the mind*.
- Explains...
	- Why *only humans* have language. (We evolved a specific faculty for language that other animals have not.)
	- Why language is acquired *universally*. (Genetic endowment of the species.)

#### Grammar
- Internal representation of **rules** of language.
- Generate some structures but not others.
- "**Generative grammar**"
	- This is the background (core) of the research program known as **generative linguistics**.
	- Still the dominant paradigm in linguistics.
- Language faculty is a "mental organ" characterized by a grammar.

##### Universal Grammar
- Innate part of the language faculty that "maps a course of experience into particular grammar that constitutes the system of mature knowledge of a language."
- Often characterized as *what the child innately knows about language*.
- Relates to [poverty of the stimulus](1-what-is-cog-sci#the-poverty-of-the-stimulus).
- Might be other mental organs with other types of knowledge??? (Music, math, etc...)

### Neocartesian Faculties
- Fodor: Chomsky's mental organs are Neocartesian faculties.
- The language faculty is a *body of knowledge*, which represents rules.
	- Different bodies of knowledge for different domains/tasks.
- What's innate is a bunch of **possible grammars**.
- Plug in one course of experience -> English.
	- You learn language by pruning a "hypothesis", confirming and testing your hypotheses for what is correct and not.
	- You gain evidence by just watching and listening to people speak.
	- *Narrow down* which hypotheses are correct.
- **Fits with a computational account of cognition**
- Parsing a sentence = drawing an inference...
- Same would be true of **Acquiring a language**

### Organs as Mechanisms
- Cartesian Faculties (if they exist) can't be the whole story about the mind...
	- **Example:** Memory
- What propositional knowledge could allow you to remember that cats are mammals.

#### Memory
- Short-term memory limits ("[magic number 7](../cog-sci/8-memory)")
	- Outdated... 3 or 4 items, or none.
	- **You chunk the items into different chunks** and those chunks of 3-4 in length.
- **Fodor:** "There's a box in your head and when you try to put more than seven things in it, some of the things start to fall out."
- **Not a body of knowledge**, but a *mechanism*.

---

- **Mechanism** explain how representations interact + cause behavior.
	- Why do we go from "p" and "if p then q" to "q" 

#### Infinite Regress
- Lewis Carrol, "What the Tortoise Said to Achilles" (1895)
	- Achilles tries to prove a proposition with a logical argument. (1. p 2. if p then q; so q)
	- The tortoise asks why 1 and 2 entail q; there must be a hidden premise which says:
		- 3. if p and if p then q, then q.
	- But then the tortoise can ask why 1,2, and 3 entail q, there must be *another* hidden premise which says:
		- 4. if p and if p then q, and if p and if p then q, then q, then q.
	- And so on.


---

- Everybody should posit **some** innate mechanisms.
- **Empiricists**:
	- Would not posit a language organ or structured language rules...
	- **No innate content**, very *few* innate mechanisms.
		- Some ability to recognize patterns.
		- *Copy principle* (sense perception and copying it)
- **Rationalists**:
	- Some innate content, More innate mechanisms.

### Horizontal Faculties

1. Mechanisms (not knowledge)
2. Relatively small in number
3. General across content domains

### Vertical Faculties

1. Mechanisms (not knowledge)
2. Relatively large in number
3. Domain specific

> Not that you have some faculty of judgment or memory, but something like a "language faculty", a "math faculty", or a "music faculty"

- Not mere dispositions - psychologically real mechanisms.
	- You might have the mechanism (competence) but not be disposed to use it (performance)
	- *Performance error*, not a *competence error*

---

- **Gall:** People might have good memory for chess but not music, so there can't be one memory.
- **Fodor:** No bc. memory for chess/music could be an *interaction*
	- Memory + knowledge of domain + past experience.
- **Can't infer** from different *performance* to no shared *competence* (mechanism)

---


## Domain Specificity

### Mandatoriness
- Input systems are not under "executive control."
- You can choose what to think about.

##### Stroop Task
- The *Stroop Effect* - 
	- Say the color of the font
- You *Just cant help processing it*
- **Lexical identification** is mandatory (or "automatic")

##### Caveats
1. Attention

- If you are absorbed in some task, you may fail to parse what someone says.
	- Fodor: this minimizes the *input* to the parser, or the extend to which the *output* is cognized.
	- The operation of the parser (transforming inputs into outputs) is *still mandatory*
- **Covert Attention** vs **Overt Attention**
	- You can do this with your senses.

1. Re-interpretation

- Paints (or experts) might be able "see" the 2D projection of 3D objects.
	- Fodor: This is a post-module re-interpretation of the output, not an effect on processing within the module.

---

- **Mandatory=** Hold fixed the input (e.g. don't shut your eyes, stop up ears, etc...), and you will always get the output.
- "Think of an utterance of 'All Gaul is divided into three parts' as an acoustic object. Now try hearing an utterance of 'All Gaul is divided into three parts' as an acoustic object. Notice the difference."
- Potential counterexample: Semantic satiation.
	- Words start to lose meaning and you stop processing the meaning when you repeat it.

### Information Encapsulation

- 1940s/50s: "New look" psychology.
- Perception is driven by expectations & values.
- People slower/less accurate at recognizing the color of a playing card if it doesn't match the suit.
	- A black heart.

#### "New Look"
- How does perception having access to your expectations (playing cards) & values (coins) square with speed and manditoriness of perception?
- Fodor: We don't want input systems to have access to *all of your expectations and values.*
	- *Encapsulation*
		- They only have access to *proprietary store of information*.
			- Specialized information, does **not** include all your background knowledge, feelings, etc...
		- Example: Light from above prior
- Quicker to avoid having to sift through all that background info.


---

- Starkest examples: *illusions*
	- Muller-Lyer Pulsating Star
- McGurk effect keeps working even after you know he's saying "ba"

---

#### Carpentered World
- One hypothesis is the "carpentered world hypothesis"
- Longer lines look further away because of corners constructed in certain cultural environments.
- However, blind children who have cataracts removed are *immediately susceptible*.

---

*Instead,* informational encapsulation seems to rely on info about length cues that is **innately available to vision.**

- Remains impossible to "unsee"
- Vision is to some degree *insensitive*... #todo huh??

#### Why Encapsulation
- **Fodor:** The *point* of perception is to contradict belief.
- You don't want it to tell you what you expect to be out there.
- You want it to tell you what is out there, even if it doesn't align with your expectations.
- **It explains why input systems are fast**
- Can simply ignore most of the info stored in the mind.
	- No need to search through all of your knowledge to see what's relevant.
- Input systems just make assumptions that are reliable. (Light from above prior)

##### Caveat (a)
- "The information that input systems provide must somehow be reconciled with background knowledge."
	- Even if it doesn't access the background knowledge.
- You don't end up thinking that the lines to the right are equally long.
- But this is something that happens cognitively -- input systems say their piece + you sort out what's true.

##### Caveat (b)
- "Evidence for the cognitive penetrability "
- Multiple systems might perform the same function.
	- Fodor: What word comes next in "I have the pepper, but please pass the ..."
- If the signal is degraded (can't hear it well), people will understand the sentence better if it ends with "salt" than if it ends with "dog"

##### Caveat (c)
- There can be "top-down" information flow *within* input systems without violating encapsulation.
	- Fodor's example: If the 's' in 'legislation' is replaced with a cough, people still hear the 's'


### Wishful Thinking
- Recall the "New Look": Perception driven by expectations and values.
- Balcetis & Dunning (2010) are an example of the revival of this perspective.
	- Their Question: does visual perception of distance have access to our desires.
- Encapsulation *says* that this should NOT ever happen.

---


##### Experiment 1
- Will thirst affect perception of how far away bottle of water is?
	- n=47.
	- Some Ss drink water (quenched) others each salty pretzels (thirsty)
	- Sit across from full bottle of water 36 in. away - rate desirability and verbally estimate distance.
- **Result:**
	- Thirsty Ss rated water as more desirable than quenched (p<0.001)
	- Thirsty Ss also estimated that the bottle was ~10% *closer* (25.1 in vs 28.0 in) (`p=0.05`)


---

- Does the nonverbal DV (dependent variable) really eliminate the possibility of the effect as being post-perceptual?
	- Example: Suppose I tell you before the study that I'll give you \$20 if you underthrow the beanbag.
	- Does you underthrowing the beanbag show anything about your visual perception?

## Chomsky: Review of Verbal Behavior

> This is Noam Chomsky's review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior paper and that verbal learning is based on [behaviorism](../cog-sci/2-history-of-the-mind#Behaviorism).

- Chomsky thinks the claims made by Skinner are bold and remarkable.
	- He thinks its surprising that Skinner places limitations on the ways in which the observables of behavior are studied.
	- Argues that with more complexed organisms, there would need to be knowledge of the inner workings of the organism as well. 
- However, Chomsky criticizes Skinner for not justifying these claims properly.
	- The lab results, although genuine, can not be applied to human behavior in the same way, and is very "gross and superficial"
	- Calls the attempt to attribute verbal behavior to Behaviorism a "failure" and is trying to use it as an example to highlight the importance of considering all the factors.
- Main points of his argument lie in the num. and range of examples he proposes for functional analysis.
- Chomsky points out inconsistencies in Skinner's definition of stimulus, response and reinforcement and what behavior is lawful by definition.
	- Skinner uses experimental evidence to prove the scientific nature of Behaviorism, but then uses guesses to prove its scope.
- Skinner's definitions of stimuli and response changes between his books. Prior, he narrowed definitions for these terms and said the descriptions of behaviors are not valid until the defining properties of stimulus and response are properly specified, demonstrated and the dynamic changes to the behavior are shown to be lawful. He then does exactly that
- Skinner's definition of stimuli has lost all objectivity and is now "driven back into the organism."
	- Instead of knowing the stimuli ahead of time, you only know the current stimuli when the person responds.
	- Skinner's claim that his system permits practical control is false.
- Skinner's use of "control" is a misleading paraphrase for traditional "denote" or "refer"
	- No objectivity or characterization of the notion of 'stimulus control'

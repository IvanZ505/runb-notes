# Unit 1: What is Cognitive Science

## Chomsky vs Skinner

> "...perhaps the most devastating book review ever written." - Peter Godfrey-Smith

- Behaviorism vs. cognitivism
- Set the stage for cognitive science and linguistics to focus on internal, mental phenomena and meaning/reference.
	- Table, the item is the stimulus, but the behavioral is interpreting it to be a table.

### Classical Conditioning

- Pavlov was not really a behaviorist, but was interested in a more open-minded and scientific way.
- Pavlov rang a bell before feeding dogs.
- Even if there was no food, when the bell was rang, the dogs were salivating.
- It seems that there is some *association* with the sound of the bell and the food.
- **Unconditioned Stimulus** - Food
	- There is no need to be trained on the stimulus.
- **Unconditioned response** - Salivating
	- The dogs need not be trained to salivate to the food stimuli
- **Conditioned stimulus** (CS)- Bell
	- By ringing the bell, the dogs are *conditioned* to recognize this stimuli.

> This is what is called *classical conditioning* = pairing response to CS.

#### Steps
- Conditioning works by *co-presenting two stimuli*
- Response to the unconditioned stimuli "rubs off" onto the CS.
- ***Association***
- It is supposed to be "simple" - no need to posit rational thought, just brute association.
	- Brute connection between food and salivation. It just *happens*. Then, by associating the bell with food, you conditioned that *bell* with the salivatory response.

#### Strength of Association
- Test the strength of the association by seeing how long + intense the response is during *extinction*.
- *Extinction* = Presentation of CS without the US (e.g. bell without food)
	- Should take a LOT of trials of extinction if you go through thousands of trials of association.
- *Could this extend to humans???*

## Behaviorism
- *Watson (1920)* - "Little Albert" experiments.
- 12 m/o was scared by loud noises.
- When loud noises were present, there would also be furry animals.
- Albert was then associating fear with furry animals.

### Operant Conditioning
- Increase/decrease stimulus-response pairing through *reinforcement* + *punishment*.
- Positive reinforcement (+ good)
- Negative reinforcement (- bad)
	- You take away something bad. (If you are shocking the rat, once they press the lever, the shocking stops.)
- Positive punishment (+ bad)
- Negative punishment (- good)

### Classical Associationism
- Problem: What is associated with what, exactly? 
- Classical associationism: A representation ("idea") of the bell is associated w representation of food.

---

### Behaviorism Cont.
- Talk of the mind, representations, etc., is unscientific
- We can just talk about the paired *stimulus* and *response*.
	- "Stimulus" = thing out there in the world.
	- "Response" = observable behavior. (Smiling when seeing your friend.)
		- Feeling happy when seeing friend **is not** a response.
- ***All behavior is conditioned***

1. In Behaviorism, there is *no appeal* to mental states -- only stimulus-response pairings.
2. No appeal to anything innate beyond. (Everything is learned to Behaviorists except things inborn/innate.)
	1. "Instincts" (US-response pairings)
	2. "Drives" (Hunger... etc)

##### Why would you want to explain all behavior with such simple tools?

- Empirical motivation: Move beyond "[introspective](../cog-decision/cognitive-architecture#Introspection)" psychology.
	- Behaviorism was an EXTREME move in the opposite direction to say, "nuh uh, nothing wit the mind"
- Philosophical motivation: Exorcise the "ghost in the machine" (Ryle, Quine)
	- Around the time Chomsky, there was also a lot of philosophy.

##### Language
- What is a scientifically respectable counterexample?
	- "Feelings don't count"
- Language: Rich, sophisticated, unpredictable, distinctively human, and *expresses thought*
	- Professor is conveying so much information through just talking.
	- Can it really be all attributed to conditioning and Behaviorism???
		- Most remote from Behaviorism.
- Skinner knew that, so he wrote *Verbal Behavior* (1957) - Radical extension of Behaviorism to complex human behavior.

### Skinner Box

- Stimulus: Light flash
- Response: Bar press
- Reinforcer: Food
- Punishment: Shock

> These are all relatively well-defined in these experiments.

#### Chomsky's Critique

- *Dilemma* - Two horns:

1. These terms are used with their technical meanings and the theory is *obviously false*
2. They are vague and empty, and *secretly smuggle in mental states*

##### First Horn: Stimulus
- Must be a lawful relation between Stimulus (S) and Response (R)
	- The S "controls" the R.
- When you look at a painting and say "Dutch" - What's the S? The painting?
	- Same S when you say "Vermeer" or "Clashes with the wallpaper", or "I thought you liked abstract art"
	- There is no reason to assume that each time the stimulus is presented, they will give the same response.
- **No lawful pairing.** - Obviously false

> Skinner argues that you are NOT thinking of the stimulus in the right way.

- There are subtle properties of the painting that causes a different stimuli, so each time, it is NOT the same stimuli.

> "*Stimuli are no longer part of the outside physical world; they are driven back into the organism. We identify the stimuli when we hear the response. It is clear from such examples, which abound, that the talk of 'stimulus control' simply disguised a complete retreat to mentalistic psychology.*" - Chomsky

- Horn 2: Vacuous, smuggles in mental notions (What you're attending to, thinking about)

#### Proper Nouns

##### Skinner
- Verbal responses that are "under the control of a stimulus"
- Is a little weird, as you can use names for people you've never encountered directly, like Chomsky. 
	- You can still refer to them as Chomsky even though you do not have that stimulus.
- By this definition, the *response* to seeing that stimulus again and again should be the same!
	- You are constantly "stimulated by" yourself, and yet not constantly saying your own name (no S "control")

> "It appears that the word 'control' here is merely a misleading paraphrase for the traditional 'denote' or 'refer'" - Chomsky

- *Horn 1* or *Horn 2* again.

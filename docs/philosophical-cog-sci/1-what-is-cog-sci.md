# Unit 1: What is Cognitive Science

## Chomsky vs Skinner

> "...perhaps the most devastating book review ever written." - Peter Godfrey-Smith

- Behaviorism vs. cognitivism
- Set the stage for cognitive science and linguistics to focus on internal, mental phenomena and meaning/reference.
	- Table, the item is the stimulus, but the behavioral is interpreting it to be a table.

### Classical Conditioning

- Pavlov was not really a behaviorist, but was interested in a more open-minded and scientific way.
- Pavlov rang a bell before feeding dogs.
- Even if there was no food, when the bell was rang, the dogs were salivating.
- It seems that there is some *association* with the sound of the bell and the food.
- **Unconditioned Stimulus** - Food
	- There is no need to be trained on the stimulus.
- **Unconditioned response** - Salivating
	- The dogs need not be trained to salivate to the food stimuli
- **Conditioned stimulus** (CS)- Bell
	- By ringing the bell, the dogs are *conditioned* to recognize this stimuli.

> This is what is called *classical conditioning* = pairing response to CS.

### Association
- Conditioning works by *co-presenting two stimuli*
- Response to the unconditioned stimuli "rubs off" onto the CS.
- It is supposed to be "simple" - no need to posit rational thought, just brute association.
	- Brute connection between food and salivation. It just *happens*. Then, by associating the bell with food, you conditioned that *bell* with the salivatory response.

#### Strength of Association
- Test the strength of the association by seeing how long + intense the response is during *extinction*.
- *Extinction* = Presentation of CS without the US (e.g. bell without food)
	- Should take a LOT of trials of extinction if you go through thousands of trials of association.
- *Could this extend to humans???*

## Behaviorism
- *Watson (1920)* - "Little Albert" experiments.
- 12 m/o was scared by loud noises.
- When loud noises were present, there would also be furry animals.
- Albert was then associating fear with furry animals.

### Operant Conditioning
- Increase/decrease stimulus-response pairing through *reinforcement* + *punishment*.
- Positive reinforcement (+ good)
- Negative reinforcement (- bad)
	- You take away something bad. (If you are shocking the rat, once they press the lever, the shocking stops.)
- Positive punishment (+ bad)
- Negative punishment (- good)

### Classical Associationism
- Problem: What is associated with what, exactly? 
- Classical associationism: A representation ("idea") of the bell is associated w representation of food.
- But could we get rid of the "ideas"

---

### Behaviorism Cont.
- Talk of the mind, representations, etc., is unscientific
- We can just talk about the paired *stimulus* and *response*.
	- "Stimulus" = thing out there in the world.
	- "Response" = observable behavior. (Smiling when seeing your friend.)
		- Feeling happy when seeing friend **is not** a response.
- ***All behavior is conditioned***

1. In Behaviorism, there is *no appeal* to mental states -- only stimulus-response pairings.
2. No appeal to anything innate beyond. (Everything is learned to Behaviorists except things inborn/innate.)
	1. "Instincts" (US-response pairings)
	2. "Drives" (Hunger... etc)

##### Why would you want to explain all behavior with such simple tools?

- Empirical motivation: Move beyond "[introspective](../cog-decision/cognitive-architecture#Introspection)" psychology.
	- Behaviorism was an EXTREME move in the opposite direction to say, "nuh uh, nothing wit the mind"
- Philosophical motivation: Exorcise the "ghost in the machine" (Ryle, Quine)
	- Around the time Chomsky, there was also a lot of philosophy.

##### Language
- What is a scientifically respectable counterexample?
	- "Feelings don't count"
- Language: Rich, sophisticated, unpredictable, distinctively human, and *expresses thought*
	- Professor is conveying so much information through just talking.
	- Can it really be all attributed to conditioning and Behaviorism???
		- Most remote from Behaviorism.
- Skinner knew that, so he wrote *Verbal Behavior* (1957) - Radical extension of Behaviorism to complex human behavior.

## Skinner Box

- Stimulus: Light flash
- Response: Bar press
- Reinforcer: Food
- Punishment: Shock

> These are all relatively well-defined in these experiments.

#### Chomsky's Critique

- *Dilemma* - Two horns:

1. These terms are used with their technical meanings and the theory is *obviously false*
2. They are vague and empty, and *secretly smuggle in mental states*

##### First Horn: Stimulus
- Must be a lawful relation between Stimulus (S) and Response (R)
	- The S "controls" the R.
- When you look at a painting and say "Dutch" - What's the S? The painting?
	- Same S when you say "Vermeer" or "Clashes with the wallpaper", or "I thought you liked abstract art"
	- There is no reason to assume that each time the stimulus is presented, they will give the same response.
- **No lawful pairing.** - Obviously false

> Skinner argues that you are NOT thinking of the stimulus in the right way.

- There are subtle properties of the painting that causes a different stimuli, so each time, it is NOT the same stimuli.

> "*Stimuli are no longer part of the outside physical world; they are driven back into the organism. We identify the stimuli when we hear the response. It is clear from such examples, which abound, that the talk of 'stimulus control' simply disguised a complete retreat to mentalistic psychology.*" - Chomsky

- Horn 2: Vacuous, smuggles in mental notions (What you're attending to, thinking about)

#### Proper Nouns

##### Skinner
- Verbal responses that are "under the control of a stimulus"
- Is a little weird, as you can use names for people you've never encountered directly, like Chomsky. 
	- You can still refer to them as Chomsky even though you do not have that stimulus.
- By this definition, the *response* to seeing that stimulus again and again should be the same!
	- You are constantly "stimulated by" yourself, and yet not constantly saying your own name (no S "control")

> "It appears that the word 'control' here is merely a misleading paraphrase for the traditional 'denote' or 'refer'" - Chomsky

- *Horn 1* or *Horn 2* again.

### Response Strength
- In the Skinner box, this is measured by rate of bar presses during extinction.

*What about in verbal behavior?*

- Volume, pitch, speed, amount + rate of repetition, low delay, size (in writing), & overall frequency or "probability"
- **Skinner:** "if we are shown a prized work of art and exclaim 'Beautiful!', the speed and energy of the response will not be lost on the owner."

##### Chomsky's Response

> "It does not appear totally obvious that in this case the way to impress the owner is to shriek in a loud, high-pitched voice, repeatedly, and with no delay (high response strength). It may be equally effective to look at the picture silently (long delay) and then murmur in a soft, low pitched voice. (By def, very low response strength.)"

- Skinner's measurements of verbal behavior response strength is bogus.

#### Reinforcer
- Why do we expend effort doing novel, creative behavior (music, writing, even talking to yourself)?
	- Validation? 
- Skinner: "*Verbal behavior* may reach over centuries or to thousands of listeners or readers at the same time. The writer may not be reinforced often or immediately, but his net reinforcement may be great."
	- This is contradictory, as in a Behaviorist model, the "thought" of the reinforcement should **not** be in the theory.

##### Chomsky's Response to Reinforcer
- Future readers aren't reinforcing S, because they are not a S at all!
- The phrase "X is reinforced by Y" (stimulus, state of affairs, events, etc...) is a *cover term* for "X wants Y, X likes Y, X wishes that Y were the case", etc...
	- "Reinforcement" here does not have any explanatory force.
	- Calls Skinner delusional for trying to use "this paraphrase to introduce any new clarity or objectivity into the description of wishing, liking, etc..."

#### Two Deeper Problems

*With Skinner's proposal as well as Behaviorism in general*

##### Syntax of a sentence is not observable
- John is easy to please... vs John is eager to please...
	- In the ordering of the sentence, everything is laid out the same.
- **Paraphrase:** It's easy to please John.
- **Paraphrase:** \* It's eager to please John.
	- Syntactically, this is not a correct sentence.

> "the syntactical organization of an utterance is not something directly represented in any simple way in the physical structure of the utterance itself."

- The basic structures of language does not account for all the nuances of language.
	- The attachment of sentence modifiers is done completely separate to the structure of the sentence.

## Language Acquisition

#### Operant Conditioning
- Operant conditioning is slow and incremental.
	- Conditioning is something that increases and decreases in strength and requires multiple iterations.
- Chomsky argues that children hear scattered bits of language, and don't learn only from explicit instruction + reinforcement.
	- You create a lot of novel sentences. There is no trouble getting the structure of the sentence.

### The Poverty of the Stimulus
- We know way more than if we just stored our life experiences.
- Must be some part of language that is *innate*


#### Universal Grammar
- There's something about humans that allow us to acquire language on the basis of limited input.
	- Overcome the poverty of the stimulus and acquire language.
- We *constantly* understand and produce grammatical sentences we've never heard.
- *No form of conditioning* can explain genuinely novel, but rule-governed behavior.
	- Kids may overgeneralize a rule. "Teach" â†’ "Teached"
	- Kids won't say sentences totally out of order.
- Knowing a language is *knowing a set of rules* for constructing well-formed sentences.
	- Learned through unknown mechanisms w/ unknown innate component.
- What is acquired when we learn to speak?
	- "Grammar"
- How do we acquire this?
	- Language seems to be something everyone can accomplish without trying to.
	- Done through observation.

### Cognitivism
- Enormously influential conception of "behavioral science" (now called cognitive science)
- Linguistic notions like meaning, reference, grammar and related psychological notions like thought, knowledge, concepts, are needed to formulate problems being studied.

## The Computational Theory of Mind
- *Not everyone endorses, but the most widely accepted.*
- Computational systems transform representations in accordance with rules.
- Representations are symbols that have *content* (ie. they *represent* things in the world; they have *intentionality*)
	- The representations are like symbols on the ticker tape for a Turing Machine.
	- We move from one thought to the next, just like a Turing Machine.
- Ex: If you think "it's raining" and "if it's raining then the streets are wet", what do you think next?
- Hypothesis: You have *symbols* in your mind that correspond to these thoughts.
	- They have the form "P" and "If P then Q"
	- **Then,** there is a rule that says to transform any pair of symbol of the form `P` and `If P then Q` into a symbol in the form of `Q`
	- This **explains and predicts** that you conclude Q, and provides a mechanism (computation)

### Reductive Neuroscience
- We can't directly *see* mental representations or computations.
- That's because presentations and computations are *functional*.
	- Just like a computer program -- **defined by what it does**
		- It's like a functional entity. E.g. Microsoft Word. (You can't find it in the computer, but what matters is that it executes the functions that it was made for.)
- But... we can directly observe and manipulate the...


- This tendency is to some extent due to practical concerns.
	- We can **observe** and **intervene** on neural processes much more easily than cognitive processes.
	- Also, that's where the money goes.
- But it often encourages a *reductive* attitude toward cognition.
	- We need to think about *why* these things in the brain are happening.
- **Cognition is nothing more** than neural mechanisms.

#### Krakauer et al.
- Cognitive Neuroscientists mounted a strong critique of reductionism.
- Their basic point: looking at neural processes alone won't tell you anything about cognition.
- You need to know what those neural processes and *implementing*.

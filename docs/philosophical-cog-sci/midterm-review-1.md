# Midterm 1: What is Cog Sci?

##### Tips
- Tell me what this is? Make sure you can answer that.
- Ask you to use your understanding to answer questions.
- Know some of the important studies.
- *Microchip experiment*
- **Krakauer** but not bridge laws
- **Fodor** but introduction to language of thought
- Make sure to look through the slides before and after the relevant day.

## Chomsky v Skinner

### Classical Conditioning
- Pavlov's dogs
- Stimulus with the bells.
- **Association** of the CS with the response.
	- Brute forced association.

#### Stimulus and Response
- Something out in the World that triggers a response.
	- The following response is a observable behavior due to the stimulus.
- Separated by *unconditional stimulus*, *unconditioned response* and *conditioned stimulus*
	- In Pavlov's dogs, the example would be food (US), salivation (UR), and the bell (CS)
#### Extinction
- How long the conditioned response takes to fade. This is also related to the *strength of association*, aka how strong of an association is formed.

## Behaviorism
- Everything in the world can be explained with stimuli and response pairings.
- There is nothing about the mind or mental states at all.
- **All behavior** is conditioned.

### Skinner Box
- Light box, bar press, food, and shock.
- Apparatus used to show conditioned behavior or rats to avoid punishment and receive rewards.

## Chomsky Critique of 'Verbal Behavior'
- Using terms in a precise way that leads to false predictions of how to use language.
- Proper name is a response under the control of a certain stimulus.
	- Taking these terms and their precise defn. leads to contradictions and incorrectness.
- *Stimulus* in the painting, showing someone a painting, they'll say one thing or another.
	- Saying that's a response there is just wrong.
		- Skinner says the stimulus is a different stimulus.

### Skinner Response Strength
- In the Skinner box, measured by rate of bar presses during extinction.
- For verbal behavior, Skinner argues that this is expressed through things like volume, pitch, speed, amount + rate of repetition, etc...
- Chomsky argues that this is ridiculous as someone can marvel slowly that a painting is beautiful and convey the same response (perhaps even more)

### Reinforcer
- Something to reinforce the stimulus and make it occur.
- Why would we expend effort on novel and creative behavior if there is no reinforcer on those?
	- Skinner thinks that its because even though your reinforcement isn't immediately, the net reinforcement over a long period of time is great.
- This is contradictory, as in a Behaviorist model, the "thought" of the reinforcement should **not** be in the theory.

## Computational Theory of Mind
- The mind works a little like a computer, made up of symbols and operates in a rule based manner.
- Think [Turing machine](../discrete-1/discrete-1#Turing-Machine).

## Reductive Neuroscience
- We can boil down everything in the mind to just what it does.
- Everything in the brain is defined by what it does.
- You can't directly **see** the mental representations or computations.
	- But you *can* see and manipulate the brain.
- Cognitive neuroscience focused more on neuro than cognition. 
	- *Reductive view*
	- Cognition is nothing more than a neural mechanism.

## Marr's Three Levels

### Computational Level
- What is the system doing?
- What function is it computing?
- **Chess example:** 

### Algorithmic Level
- What is the process by which it performs function?
- What *algorithm* is it implementing? What are the symbols + processes involved?

### Implementation Level
- How is it actually being implemented?

#### Microchip Example

- A lot of people studying the mind only hit the implementation level.
	- Microchip study shows this.
	- Just looking at implementation level doesn't say anything without thinking of the other levels.
- **Might be asked specifically the microchip example!**

### Microchip Experiment
- Microchips running old games. (80s games)
- How much insight can we get into cognitive functions by looking into things from a neurological perspective.
- Techniques used in neuroscience like fMRI but implemented in the sense of like "Electrical signals"
- Almost like doing it sarcastically. (Krakauer)


## Neuroconnectionism
- Won't ask what a neural network is, but should know what a neural network is, and how it differs from a *classical* framework.

### ANN

#### Goldilocks Zone
- ANNs are in the *goldilocks zone* of computational abstractions.
	- Not too complexed and not too abstract.
	- Balance between biological realism and algorithmic clarity.
- **Silico copies of brain regions** -> Too detailed to be computationally tractable.
- **Box and Arrow Cognitive Models** -> Too computational with no base in biology.


##### The Belt of ANNs
- 4 components of neural networks, architectures, training sets, learning rules, objectives.
	- Architecture: what framework makes up the ANN
	- Training set: The database that the ANN is trained on, pics or text
	- Objectives: What the ANN sets out to accomplish (task)
	- Learning rules: What rules are used to tweak the hidden nodes to get more accurate answers.

## Research Programs
- How it differs
- The core of a research program vs the belt

### The Core

- Background assumptions about what you're studying.
- They *define* the research program and not abandoned without abandoning the research program.

##### Example
- In Neuroconnectionism, one of the cores would be "ANNs are useful for studying cognition"
	- Abandoning this means abandoning the Neuroconnectionism network.

### The Belt
- The Auxiliary (accompanying) hypothesis that are the claims that *are* tested within the research program.
- These *can be abandoned*.
- **The different components** of the belt of a research program can be **progressive** and **degenerating**.
	- *Progressive*: Produces new and novel hypothesis and findings.
	- *Degenerating*: It does not produce anything new or novel.
		- Degenerating hypothesis can lead to the death of a research program.

> Degeneration of a research program causes people to abandon it.

##### Example
- In Neuroconnectionism, which ANNs can test particular cognitive functions.
- Goldilocks zone?


## Aphasia

### Components in Language
- A grammar (where words go in the sentence)
- A lexicon (what the words (components) themselves mean)

### Anomia
- An inability to understand the lexicons.
- - Use of individual words.
### Agrammatism
- An inability to understand the grammar.
	- The boy kissed the girl/The girl kissed the boy
	- Unable to tell the difference between these two words.
		- Lose ability to put the different components of the sentence together.

> Not entirely distinct (impairments of one always correlate to some impairment of the other, but not equally severe.)


### Studies that Were Talked About
- People with agrammatism were tested on particular abilities like ToM, cross-domain integration and calculations.
	- Why? Being blind and hearing better. Adapting to a lifetime of a certain impairment.
- Tell me about aphasia and aphasia and the theory of mind in relation to Language of Thought.

## Classical Architectures

#### Combinatorial Syntax and Semantics
- Language representations have PARTS and a syntactical relationship between the two of them.
- *If you **have*** this, then you have a structure of those operations, and with this comes the structure sensitive operations.

#### Structure Sensitive Operations
- It is just looking at the structures and not the contents.
- `p then q`, you can compute `q` without knowing what `q` stands for.
-  You can infer from "This is a red square" to "This is a square"
	- Doesn't matter that it's both red and square, you can use the STRUCTURE to do the work.
- More about the formula than what's in it.

##### Example
- It's raining.
- If its raining then the streets are wet.
- The streets are wet.

## Connectionist Architecture

- Representations are nodes in a network; mental processes involve activating nodes, and activation spreading from node to node
- **Evidence** - Semantic priming

---

- Consists of  
	- nodes (which have content, like nurse),  
	- links (which connect the nodes), + 
	- weights (which modulate strength of links)


---

###### Not Tested

- Classical and connectionist could be compatible, you brain might be implementing a classical architecture within a connectionist architecture.
- Or maybe both are running in your mind at the same time.


---

## Theory of Mind
- Involves some combination in your thinking
- And if Varley proved aphasics can still do this combinations in their thinking despite agrammatism, it means that this is spoken language does not relate to how people do calculations in their head.

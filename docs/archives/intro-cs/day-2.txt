Assignments: 

Algorithm Development:

1. Analyze:
	Understand the problem you are solving.
2. Solve:
	Develope a step by step algo.
	Use a "language" to express it
3. Evaluate:
	Play a human computer to see how the algo works.
	Mistake? Go back to 1 and/or 2.


ALGO RUNTIME: Understand the running time of an algo.


Example:

Inputs: HoursW, wage
Output: Salary

Errors: negative hours, wages <=0

READ HoursW 				-- 1 operation
READ wages  				-- 1 operation
if(HoursW < 0) or (wages <= 0):		-- 2 operations
	DISPLAY error			-- 1 operation
else:					-- no operations
	HoursW * wages = salary		-- 1 operation
	Sys.out.print(salary)		-- 1 operations
ENDIF					-- 0 operations

mod--- % (12 %2 = 0)

# [Ch8: Memory](cog-sci.md)

At the end of the day, memory is for storing and retrieving information.

Similar to computer memory systems too
- long term memory = hard drive / disk for physically storing permanent data
- short term memory = RAM for temporary information that will be wiped clean when the computer turns off. Acts as a buffer
Sensory memory = initial processing
- Unfiltered 
- Large capacity and short duration
- Organized by different modalities (iconic, echoic)
- Uniquely encodes information (creates mental representations) for each modality

### Short Term Memory

(This is also called working memory) 
- Accessing and manipulating information
- Some filtering (selective attention - brain must decide what information is important enough to access)
- Small capacity and short duration
- Rehearsal allows this to pass to long term (consolidation)
- Chunking and decay

### Long term memory
- Storing information for later access
- Large capacity and long duration
- Organized by type of information rather than modality

---

Ex: Grid of letters
- Easier to remember a whole row of letters when you hear the sound tone
- Tells us that all info is in sensory memory but we don’t have time to look at all of it
- Only a small amount of sensory memory gets sent to short-term/working memory

Capacity of working memory?
- The magical number 7+-2 (George Miller, 1956)
- But what counts as items? It varies depending on how you chunk things (letters can be items, but letters can be chunked into acronyms, which are new items)
- Information decays in a minute or two unless there’s rehearsal
- Maintenance rehearsal = repeating things in short-term memory
- Elaborative rehearsal = connecting things in short-term memory with things already in long-term memory

Serial position effect: we are more likely to remember things at the beginning or end of a list

- Why? Because the first items come into an empty memory buffer and we rehearse it the most (primacy)
- And the last items are still in your memory buffer when you are asked to recall (recency)

Search algorithms in working memory…

- Serial processing = sequential search
- Cares about size of set and location of probe in set
- If it continues searching after it has found the probe, then this is exhaustive search instead of self-terminating
- Parallel processing = check all items at once by representing them visually
- Time does not increase if set increases. O(1)
- The brain seems to be using exhaustive serial processing

- But exhaustive seems inefficient (why do we continue searching if we have already found it? Maybe because we want all instances, or because this searching isn’t a natural process, or because we want to double check). Exhaustive search implies that we aren’t in complete control of how search is executed (because we would rather use self-terminating search).
  

Long term memory is divided into…

- Episodic = events/experiences (explicit/declarative)
- Semantic = facts and general knowledge (explicit/declarative)
- Procedural = how to do things (implicit/nondeclarative)
- Often motor skills
- Highly automatic
- Ex: tying your shoes, riding a bike, playing piano

LTM concepts…

- Constructive processing = reorganizing/updating memories because of logic/reasoning/new info
- Pseudo-memory = false memory that you believe to be true
- Network model = seeing LTM as system of linked information
- Redintegration = one memory is a cue to trigger another memory

Von Restorff effect = we remember things that seem noteworthy

### Reconstruction

- Every time we access a memory, we reconstruct it, so it’s being changed in small ways
- Reconstruction is heavily based on culture and a basic schema (prototype), which we use to fill in the details
- If memory is reconstructed, we should take eyewitness testimony less seriously

Encoding specificity = the encoding of an idea during original learning determines what kinds of cues will remind us of it later.
- State-dependent memory = we tend to remember things better if our state at the time of recall is the same as at the time of learning
- States can be moods, physical place, etc...

Consolidation…

- Hippocampus transfers mental representations from working memory to long-term memory
- Anterograde amnesia = when you cannot consolidate new memories
- Retrograde amnesia = when you lose certain long-term memories
- There may be different structures in the brain for different types of memory (episodic for hippocampus, semantic for limbic cortex, etc...) 
  

Where are memories stored in the brain?
- Memories do not have discrete representations, but are distributed across a system
- Similar to connectionist networks

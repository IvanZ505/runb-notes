# [Heuristics and Biases](cog-decision.md)

## Objectives
- The battle of the JDM Superpowers: Cognitive illusions vs fast and frugal
- Dealing with uncertainty

## Heuristics
- Heuristics are a "quick and easy" rule to help us make judgments under conditions of uncertainty, with time limitations, and with our cognitive limitations.

### Kahneman
- Dual process theorist
- Classify heuristics as Type 1 processes
- We may override heuristics with Type 2 processes.

### Gigerenzer
- Critic of dual process theories
- Proposes "unified model" or "unimodel"
- Processes differ in extent to which they are conscious.

### Cognitive Illusions / Heuristics and biases

- Tversky and Kahneman
- Focus on when heuristics lead to systematic errors.
- **When is it a bad thing?**

### Fast and frugal / adaptive toolbox

 - Gigerenzer and colleagues  
 - Focus on when heuristics lead to best balance between maximizing accuracy and minimizing costs like cognitive processing and time.
 - **When is these heuristics a good thing?**

## Rationality Wars

**Great Rationality Debate** aka Rationality Wars:

- How rational/irrational are humans?
	- To what extent do we use heuristics?
	- What are the heuristics?
	- To what extent do heuristics help or hinder?
	- Which normative theories should we use?
	- Which tasks should our evolved minds be good at?

---

## Unimodels

### Misalignments in DPT
- Unconscious & slow: Sleeping on a problem
- Unconscious & intentional: Skilled activity e.g. speaking
- Uncontrollable & intentional: Bat and ball responses
- Unintentional & controllable: Stereotyping, mimicry of others
- Conscious & worse: Art poster study, etc..

Instead of Dual processes...

---

### Intuitive Judgments
- Quick, effortless, little or no conscious awareness of their origins or manner of formation.

### Deliberative Judgments
- Slow, effortful, conscious awareness of the process that led to them.

### Dual process theories
- Intuitive and deliberative judgments produced by two different kinds of processes with different kinds of rules.
- E.g. Representativeness heuristic and availability heuristic underlie intuitive judgments
- E.g. Statistical or logical rules underlie deliberative judgments.
### Unimodel
- Both intuitive judgments and deliberative judgments are rule based and the same rules can underlie both.
- Deliberative judgments not generally more accurate than intuitive judgments.

### How do we catch a ball?

- Some mathematical calculations (Dawkins 2006)
- **Gaze Heuristic**. [See more here](../cog-sci/10-the-rational-mind.md#bounded-rationality)

## The Availability Heuristic
- Estimating the probability of events based on how easily you can or could bring examples of those events to mind.
- An inference rule based on the **accessibility of exemplars**; the easier it is to bring examples of the event to conscious awareness, the  more likely the event is.
- Note that you can bring an example to mind through **memory** of past events or through **imagining** the events.

**Is the availability heuristic useful?**

Availability is typically a good cue since in general frequent events are easier to recall than infrequent events.

**When might the availability heuristic mislead us?**

Potential availability biases:
- Recent events.
- Dramatic events.
- Personal experiences.

### Ease/Speed
- Early studies of the availability heuristic failed to distinguish **ease**/**speed** with which examples come to mind and **number** of examples that come to mind.

**Which is the crucial factor?**
- Availabilitty-by-number hypothesis
- Availability-by-speed hypothesis

#### Study

- Participants asked to describe either 6 or 12 examples of very assertive or very unassertive behaviors in which they had engaged. 
- Pretests indicated that most subjects could easily generate 8 or 9 behaviors but found it very difficult to generate more than 10.  
- Participants then asked to rate their own assertiveness.  
- Participants attributed themselves higher assertiveness after recalling 6 rather than 12 examples of assertive behavior. 

This led to a famous (among JDM professors!) 2006 paper by Craig Fox called “The availability heuristic in the classroom: How soliciting more criticism can boost your course ratings”.

- Students completed a midcourse evaluation form in which they were asked to list either 2 ways in which the course could be improved (a relatively easy task) or 10 ways in which the course could be improved (a relatively difficult task).
- Respondents who had been asked for 10 critical comments subsequently rated the course more favorably than respondents who had been asked for 2 critical comments.

> Studies show that it is typically the *number* of examples that come to mind that matter.

### Law of Small Numbers

**Law of Large Numbers**

- Large samples will be representative of the population from which they are drawn.
- For example, proportions of heads after *n* flips of a fair coin will almost surely converge to 0.5 as *n* approaches infinity.

**Law of Small Numbers**

- Law of large numbers is (incorrectly) applied to small numbers, e.g. six flips of a coin.

---
## Representative Heuristics

- When A is judged more probable than B whenever A appears more representative than B.

**What is *representativeness*?**

- How similar an example is to members of its class.
- How similar a sequence is to what we think randomness is like.

### Tom Problem

- **Base Rate Condition**
	- Considering all the percentages of students enrolled in 9 different fields.
	- Then another group of participants were told some things about "Tom's" personalities.
	- Two conditions: **Similarity condition** and **Prediction condition**
		- Rank how similar Tom is to prototypical student of each area.
		- Predict the likelihood that Tom is now a graduate student in each of these fields.
	- **Question:** Are judgments of the likelihood that Tom is student in a field predicted by perceived base-rates or similarities?
	- **Results:** Similarity, not base rates, correlated positively with predictions.
	- **Conclusions:** People display "base rate neglect" and instead use the representativeness heuristic.

> Variations yielding same results.
> The *problem* is not that we are relying on the representative heuristic. However, the problem is that we **fail** to take into account *other* information that is relevant.

### Linda Problem

- Participants were told some facts about Linda. (31, single, outspoken, bright, majored in philosophy, deeply concerned with discrimination)
- Divided into 3 groups for naive, informed and sophisticated group
- Ranking 8 statements found that more people ranked **conjunctive** statements as higher than just independent statements by themselves.
	- This is even though the chance for a conjunctive statement being true is **ALWAYS** less than the chance for 1 statement being true.

## Gambler's Fallacy

## Stereotyping

- First you perceive a category.
- The perceived category then activates stereotypes of the category.
- Infer the individual has stereotypical characteristics.

> Stereotyping goes from categorization to characteristics via a generic.

For example:

- "Loyalists are stupid."
- "Loyalists have shaved heads."

### Subtyping

- When you rule out someone from a stereotype because they don't have the stereotypical properties.
	- "Well he doesn't have a shaved head so he's not *really* a loyalist."
- This leads to the extremism of the stereotyped group.

### Representativeness in Relation to Stereotypes

**The representative heuristic** goes from characteristics to categorization via similarity to a perceived exemplar.

For example:

- You have a shaved head.
- You are similar to the exemplar of a loyalist.
- You're likely a loyalist.

**This is judgment based on likelihood, which is representative heuristic.**

Whereas stereotyping would be:

- You have a shaved head, so you are a loyalist.

## Anchoring and Adjustment
- Tendency to estimate by starting at an initial value (the anchor), assessing whether it is too low or too high, and gradually adjusting it by mentally moving from the anchor.
- **Rationale**: When you lack knowledge, it is good for an estimate.
- **Problems**: You may anchor on to irrelevant information.

---
### Contrast Principle
- "Automobile dealers use the contrast principle by waiting until the price of the car has been negotiated before suggesting one option after another. In the wake of a man-thousand-dollar deal, a couple hundred extra dollars for a nicety such as an upgraded sound system seems almost trivial in comparison. The same will be true of the added expense of accessories, such as tinted windows, better tires, or special trim, that the dealer might suggest in sequence. The trick is to bring up the options independently of one another so that each small price will seem petty when compared to the already determined much larger price."
- The contract principle provides some sort of anchoring affect as well by making the overpriced houses look more like a bargain by comparison to the contrasts.

---

### Selective Accessibility

- Anchor provided → the anchor will bring examples to mind which would cause a selectivity bias.

#### Example of Selective Accessibility?

- Guess the height of building in New York.
- Given a small anchor.
- Anchor renders more accessible memories of smaller buildings.
- So, you underestimate the height of the building.
### Insufficient Adjustment

- Self-generated anchor → they do not sufficiently adjust.

**Why is there insufficient adjustment?**

- People do not have the relevant information.
- Adjustment requires attention and there may be added cognitive load in unfamiliar situations.
- Individual differences regarding effortful thinking.

> Cognitive Load: The amount of information you have to process at the same time. **DPT** will say that heavy cognitive load causes heavy usage of the working memory.

## Primacy Effect

**How do we quickly form impressions of others?**

- We know some characteristics.
- Order in which we know them is irrelevant.

### Solomon Asch

---
#### Intelligent-First Condition

- (From good to bad)
- This person is "intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious."

#### Envious-first condition

- (Goes from good to bad)

---

Also asked whether or not people would have a number of other characteristics.

Participants in the intelligent-first condition were more likely to endorse positive characteristics.

> He called these the "primacy effects" in impression formation.

### Asch's Explanation

- Later characteristics listed are *interpreted* in light of the former characteristics.
- Former characteristics act as the *background* information that the later ones are interpreted on.

---

## Attribute Substitution

- “Judgment is mediated by a heuristic when an individual assesses a specified target attribute of a judgment object by substituting another property of that object – the heuristic attribute – which comes more readily to mind”
- A heuristic is influencing a judgment when people try to answer a hard question by answering an easier one.

---

**Why does attribute substitution occur? Why did it evolve?**  

Perhaps substitute attribute is relevant and “good enough”.  

- Do I believe in climate change?
	- Do I trust people who say that climate change exists? 
- Will the project be completed on time?
	- Is the project currently on time?
- Am I satisfied with my relationship?
	- What is my mood right now?

---
### Representativeness heuristic (Attribute Substitution)
- Replace difficult probability judgment with easier similarity judgment.  

### Availability heuristic   (Attribute Substitution)
- Replace difficult probability judgment with easier judgment about how easily instances come to mind.  

### Anchoring-and-adjustment  (Attribute Substitution)
- Involves no attribute substitution!  
- Involves making a particular value of the attribute being judged seem more possible.
- Here judgment is influenced by temporarily raising the accessibility of a particular *value* of the target attribute.
- Also note that Kahneman thinks that anchoring-and-adjustment has both a type 1 and type 2 form. The adjustment can be deliberate, consciously considering reasons to adjust from the anchor.
